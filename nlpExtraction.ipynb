what john learned and so did with neural nets was super crude from a learning point of view, because the learning was like after the side not affecting the core representations.', 'Ten years ago, before this whole commercial mining explosion was on the one hand, you have these cognitive architecture guys who were working closely with psychologists and cognitive scientists who had thought a lot about how the different parts of a human like mine should work together.', 'And in some sense, what you needed to do was to get the learning that the learning theory guys were doing and put it together with the architecture, the cognitive architecture guys were doing.'], ['But the current systems, uh, not being look, for example, if you wanted to make a biologically realistic hardware neural network, like taking making a. circuit in hardware that emulated like the hodgkin huxley equation or the isakov education, like equate differential equations for a biologically realistic neuron

three to five years, we are going to see new chips where like a graph is put on the chip and, the back and forth between multiple processes acting cindy and mindy on that graph is going to be fast.',

different nodes representing, then i leks interview or whatever, the logic, relations between those things are compact in the northern link representation so that when you have a neural net acting on the same nodes and links, the neural net and the logic engine can sort of interoperate with each other and also interpretable by humans.', 'You can also have procedure like nodes and links as in, say, combinatorial logic or lambda calculus representing programs so you can have nodes and links representing many different types of semantics, which means you could make a horrible, ugly mess or you can make a system where these different types of knowledge are interpenetrate and synergized with each other beautifully.', 'Well, if you want to reason on how to improve that procedure, you need to map that procedure into logic using howard isomorphic and certain in the logic, the logic engine can reason about how to improve that procedure and then map that back into the procedural representation

the neural model as a probability oracle to guide symbolic grammar learning process.'], ['So for many years, many of us tried to take that next step and yet again, that neural network that would have not just a list of semantic latent variables, but we have said bayes net of similar variables with dependencies between them, the whole programming framework edwar was made for that.', 'So you can that is one way you use a structured learning algorithm, which is symbolic, and then you use the deep neural net as an oracle to guide the structure.', 'And so that is, i think, trying to milk the structure of a neural net by treating it as an oracle, maybe more like how your declarative mind post-process is,', 'We passed that and said, well, ok, let us try more innovative ways to learn and to learn what are the representations implicit in that network without trying to make it grow inside that network.', 'So that was a rare case where a neural net, trained with a fairly standard gane

going to arise when internal state is ideally matched to this base time features of the external demands.', 'And then you are able to adjust slice time more finely or more or less finely in order to adjust to the stimulus, the dynamics of the stimulus.', 'But i think i can comment on it from a neuroscience, which is really all i do is, well, we do experiments in the lab, but looking at things through the lens of neuroscience.', 'So what you are describing can be mapped fairly well to working memory, just keeping things online and updating them as they change and information is coming back into your brain.'], ['In physics, jack said, and i think this makes sense to me, too, that there is a reliance on working memory, but an increased reliance on some sort of deep, deep memory and deep memory stores, probably stuff that is moved out of the hippocampus and forebrain and into the cortex and is more some episodic and declarative stuff.', 'My lab has not done too much of that work in memory, but we are pushing working memory when we have people do things like these simple lights out tasks while they are under, we can increase the cognitive load by increasing the level of autonomic arousal to the point where they start doing less well.', 'So this is prefrontal cortex keeping every bit of reflexive circuitry at bay, the one that makes you want to get up and use the restroom, the one that makes you want to check your phone, all of that, but also running these interior thalamus to prefrontal cortex loops, which we know are very important for working memory.', 'And i think that it demands his argument was there is a tremendous demand on working memory to work out theorems in math and to keep a number of plates spinning, so to speak, mentally, and run back and forth between them, updating them.', 'And so when you are talking about coding or being in that tunnel of thought and trying to iterate and keeping a lot of plate spinning, it, it speaks directly to working memory.'], ['You know, we think about how we think about these operations at, really focused, keeping a lot of things online, but what you were describing is actually, it, it speaks to the very real possibility, probably that with certainty there is another element to all this, which is when you are trying out lots of things, in particular, lots of different algorithms, you do not want to be in a state of very high autonomic arousal.', 'That is not what you want, because the higher level of autonomic arousal and stress in the system, the more rigidly you are going to analyze space and time and what you are talking about is playing with space time dimensionality.', ', if you are in a rigid, high level of autonomic arousal because you are plugging in algorithms that are in this space regime, this time regime matches that space time match.', 'And what we now know, for instance, that people thought that psychedelics work by just creating spontaneous bursting of neurons and hallucinations, but that the fivish, 2c and 2a receptors, which are the main sites for things like lsd and psilocybin and some of the other halluc..., the ones that create hallucinations, the drugs that create hallucinations.', 'Whereas creativity, i always think the lava lamp is actually a pretty good example, even though it has these counterculture new agey connotations, because you actually do not know which direction things are going to change.'], ['And so sometimes i think solutions come not from being in that narrow tunnel of space time and strong activation of working memory and trying to iterate if this than this very strong deductive and inductive thinking and working from first principles, but also from states where something that was an algorithm that never you never had in existence before suddenly gets lumped with another algorithm and all of a sudden a new possibility comes to mind.', 'And what that does is that means that the space time relationship for vision, like moving my finger from here to here, very rigid space time relationship.', 'And so space and time need to be fluid and space and time need to be rigid in order to come up with something meaningful.', 'I think that drowsy states and sleep states are super interesting for accessing some of these more creative states of mind.', 'So this is very kind of tunnel vision and yet deep really relapse, excuse me, deeply relaxed, where new algorithms, if you will, can start to surface strong state for inducing neuroplasticity.'], ['So you could go into a psychedelic state very deeply for ten minutes, but you could launch yourself out of that state and place yourself into a linear, real world state very quickly so that you could extract whatever it was that happened in that experience and then go back in if you wanted.', 'You can have an amazing amplified experience housed in the amplified experience and come out of that thinking', 'But i think you could do it with virtual reality, augmented reality and other devices that bring more of the somatic experience into it.', 'They want a peak experience inside of an amplified experience.', 'You had a meaningful experience, when you did not bring anything back, you did not bring anything back.'], ['And i try to bring that to the other parts of the day that do not have it and treasure them even more in those moments because they only last

only awake for, if we are being honest, maybe a couple hours a day, early part of the day for the early part of the day.', 'But if you learn to titrate caffeine, what time of day and the kind of work that you are trying to do, you can bring that autonomic arousal state into a close to perfect place.', 'I have a long time ago, someone who i respect a lot was mentoring me, said be very careful about bringing in someone else’s sensory experience early in the day.', 'The early part of the day is interesting because the one thing that is not often discusses the transition out of sleep.'], ['If it is it sounds for you, it is very interoceptive, in the end, very, you got a lot of thinking going on and a lot of computing going on, allowing yourself to transition out of that sleep state and arrive

nature a couple of times, the action potential for a given neuron does not always have the exact same waveform people.', 'And it freaks people out because you can actually make it seem from a perception standpoint, as if the sound arrived from the corner of the room and hit you like physically and people will recoil.', 'So the brain is just a bunch of stuff firing, and it forms abstractions that are fascinating and beautiful, like layers upon layers of abstraction.', 'All neurons can do is fire in space and in time, different neuorns, in different sequences, perhaps with different intensities.'], ['Maybe even focusing on the vision system, is there something specific about the structure of the vision system, the circuitry of it that allows for the complexity of the visual system to emerge?', 'Also from the a.i. side, computer vision, as is some of the most exciting applications of neural networks, is in computer vision, but it feels like that is a neighbor of cognition and consciousness.', 'And then we are moving to higher level concepts, just the way the visual system works can be summarized in a few relatively succinct statements, unlike most of what i have said, which has not been succinct at all.', 'Well, because the beauty of the visual system, the reason david hubel and wiesel won the nobel prize was because they were brilliant and forward thinking and adventurous and all that good stuff.', 'But the reason that the visual system is such a great model for addressing these kinds of questions and other systems are hard is we can control the stimuli.'], ['But those neurons respond best to little circles of dark light or little circles of bright light, little circles of red light versus little circles of green light or blue light.', 'And then the central circadian clock informs every cell in your body about time of day and make sure that all sorts of good stuff happens if you are getting light in your eyes at the right times and all sorts of bad things happen if you are getting light randomly throughout the 24 hour cycle, we could talk about all that.', 'But you see everything from outcomes in cancer patients to diabetes, improves when people are getting light at a particular time of day and getting darkness at a particular phase of the 24 hour cycle, we were designed to get light and dark at different times of the circadian cycle.', 'There are bunch of other neurons in the eye that signal to the brain, and they mainly signal the presence of things that are lighter than background or darker than background, so black objects will darken the background, a light object lighter in the background, and that all it is mainly a it is looking at pixels.', 'It is a forebrain structure that in the first trimester there is a genetic program that made sure that neural retina, which is part of your central nervous system, was squeezed out into what is called the embryonic eye-cups, and that the bone formed with a little hole where the optic nerve is going to connect it to the rest of the brain.'], ['So that by the time you get into an area that nancy kanwisher at mit has studied her much of her career, the fusiform face area, you start finding single neurons that respond only to your father’s face or to joe rogan’s face, regardless of the orientation of his face.', 'The orientation of his face is not there, you will not even see his eyes necessarily, but he is represented in some abstract way by a neuron that actually would be called the joe rogan neuron of neurons.', 'So nancy’s lab has done that because early on she was challenged by people that said there are not face neurons, there are neurons that they only respond to space and time shapes and things like that, moving in particular directions and orientations.', 'In fact, in fact, if i showed you a black line, i could be sure that if i were imaging v1, that i would see a representation of that black line as a vertical line somewhere in your cortex.', 'I want to be clear, it is hierarchical because you do not build up that line by suddenly having a neuron that responds to lines in a some random way.'], ['And so the brain, if we are going to have a discussion about the brain and how the brain works, we need to really be clear which brain.', 'Whose work i follow, which is and it was actually on your podcast, i think elon musk said, basically the brain, what did he say, the brain is a monkey brain with a supercomputer on top.', 'But one of the reasons i forced upon myself to learn some electrophysiology, not a ton, but enough and some molecular biology and about circuitry, is that one of the most beautiful experiences you can have in life, i am convinced, is to lower an electrode into the cortex and to show a person or an animal, you do this ethically of course, stimulus is like an oriented line or a face, and you can convert the recordings coming off of that electrode into an audio signal, an audio monitor, and you can hear what they call hash.', 'So you are saying there might be a chasm in the two views of the power of the brain arising from the circuitry that forms abstractions or the power of the brain arising from the majority of the circuitry that is just doing very brute force, dumb things that are like that', 'But having spent some time, like twenty five years digging around in the brain and listening to neurons firing and looking at them anatomically, i think given it is 2020, we need to ask the right, the way to get better answers, ask better questions.'], ['It is super interesting, but i think with the tools that are available nowadays and where people are trying to head off of not just reading from the brain monitoring activity, but writing to the brain, i think we really have to be careful', 'And so as long as  the transformations, you are in a perfect place to build machines or add machines to the brain that exactly mimic what the brain wants to do, which is

in the form of light, color and light and sound waves and taste, but ideas become a form of sensory mapping.', 'What humans are really good at is taking that plasma barbell that we were talking about earlier and not just using it for analysis of space like the immediate environment, but also using historical information, like i can read a book today about the history of medicine.', 'They are not

mine do.'], ['They are stimulating the neuron that responds to dots moving up and the perception of the animal is that dots are moving up, which tells you that your perception of external reality

criticism from a listener here and there that while having a conversation with a world class mathematician, physicist, neurobiologist, aerospace engineer or theoretical computer scientists like yourself, i waste time by asking philosophical questions about free will, consciousness, mortality, love, nature of truth, superintelligence, whether time travel is possible, whether space time is emergent, fundamental, even the crazy questions like whether aliens exist, what their language might look what their math might look', 'And, and actually what we learned, throughout history, but really starting with the scientific revolution, with galileo and so on, is that there is a good reason to, focus on narrower questions, more technical, mathematical or empirical questions.', 'You can find the techmeme ride home podcast if you search your podcast app for a ride home.', 'But, math and science are tools that we have for, actually making progress and, hopefully even, changing our understanding of these philosophical questions, sometimes even more than philosophy itself does.', 'It is a technology podcast i have been listening to for a while and really enjoying it goes straight to the point, gives you the tech news you need to know and provides minimal but essential context.'], ['And i was trying to look for resources in trying to understand where the sources of disagreement and debate between wittgenstein and touring were.', 'Is one of the more fascinating documents that i have ever read because, of wittgenstein is trying to say, well, all of these formal systems that are just a complete irrelevancy is right.', 'Take a step from philosophy to actually like the biggest possible step to actual engineering with actual real impact.', 'And turing saying, well, look, if you use an inconsistent formal system to design a bridge, the bridge may make collapse.', 'You know, i think of where wittgenstein is, the where the formal systems are actually going to be used, in computers.'], ['That usually the only way to make progress on the big questions, like the philosophical questions we are talking about now is to pick off smaller sub questions, ideally sub questions you can attack using math, empirical observation or both.', 'But, with these profound philosophical questions, also art and literature do that right there, all different ways of trying to approach these questions that, we do not for which we do not even know really what an answer would look like.', 'So what is the difference between the way a computer scientist and mathematician ponders a philosophical question and a philosopher ponders the philosophical question?', 'Why ask the philosophical questions of the mathematician is if you want to ask yourself questions than invite a real philosopher on and ask them.', 'And and scientists, will often if you ask them about a philosophical problem like the hard problem of consciousness or freewill or whatever, they will try to relate it back to, recent research, research about a neurobiology or.'], ['On the other hand, if someone said, well, i have this brain scanning machine, you step into it and then, every paper that you will ever write, it will write, every thought that you will have, even right now about the machine itself, it will say, well, if you can actually demonstrate that, then i think  that sort of threatens my internal sense of having free will in a much more visceral way, but now you notice that we are asking in a much more empirical question we are asking, is such a machine possible or is not it?', 'And, and that actually asking that question gets you into all sorts of meaty and interesting issues, issues of what is the computational substrate of the brain, or can you understand the brain, just at the sort of level of the neurons, at sort of the abstraction of a neural network?', ', i. suggest just asking the question how well, in principle, consistently with the laws of physics, could a person’s behavior be predicted, without so, let us say, destroying the person’s brain, taking it apart in the process of trying to predict them.', 'But but the question is, what accuracy at the sort of level of the underlying mechanisms do you need in order to predict the behavior?', 'If you were trying to predict a person, then presumably you would need some model of their brain.'], ['Well, you could say the sort of obvious possibility which was, recognised by eddington and many others about as soon as quantum mechanics was discovered in the 1920s, was that if, let us say a sodium ion channel, in the brain, its behaviour is chaotic, right?', 'The controversial question is whether any of it matters for the sort of philosophical questions that we care about, because you could say if all it is doing is just injecting some randomness into an otherwise completely mechanistic process, well, then who cares?', 'And so, even if you knew the complete quantum state of someone’s brain, at best you could predict the probabilities that they would do one thing or do another thing.', 'Ok, because, another central fact about quantum mechanics is that making a measurement on a quantum state is an inherently destructive operation.', 'So if you could philosophize a little bit within this empirical question at where do you think would enter the by which mechanism would enter the possibility that we can not predict the outcome.'], ['But just as you said, that question may be slightly detached from the philosophical question in the sense if consciousness somehow has a role to the experience of free will, because ultimately what we are talking about free will.', 'My claim is that in a world where, there were, human level eyes where we would been even overtaken by such eyes, the entire discussion of the hard problem of consciousness would have a different character.', 'And it starts actually getting to the question of the ajai the turing questions, the demonstration of free will, the demonstration of intelligence, the demonstration of consciousness.', 'But the allex, if every time i was contemplating a decision, this machine had printed out an envelope, where i could open it and see that it knew my decision, i think that actually would change my subjective experience of making decisions.', 'And there is a reason why people try to talk around it, which is that, democritus talked about the hard problem of consciousness, in 400 b.c. in terms that would be totally recognisable to us today.'], ['So the entire trick with quantum computing, with every algorithm for a quantum computer is that you try to choreograph a pattern of interference of amplitudes and you try to do it so that for each wrong answer, some of the paths leading to that wrong answer have positive amplitudes and others have negative amplitudes.', 'Now, the central discovery that sort of quantum mechanics made is that fundamentally the world is described by these sort of, let us say, the possibilities for, what a system could be doing are described using numbers called amplitudes, which are like probabilities in some ways, but they are not probabilities.', 'And if i just measure a superposition over every possible answer, then the rules of quantum mechanics tell me that all i will see will be a random answer.', 'And if you have heard of a quantum superposition, this just means that some state of affairs where you assign an amplitude, one of these complex numbers to every possible configuration that you could see a system in on measuring it.', 'So there is this broad and deep aspect to quantum computing that represents more than just the quantum computer.'], ['But eventually where we hope to get is to what are called error corrected quantum computers, where the cubits really do behave like perfect abstract cubits for as long as we want them to.', 'We would say is that the basic unit of quantum information is the cupitt is the object, any object that can be maintained then manipulated in a superposition of zero in one states.', 'There is superconducting quantum computing that was in the news recently because of google’s quantum supremacy experiment.', 'Well, to be honest with you today, they do interfere with each other that because all the quantum computers we can build today are very noisy.', 'And so the subject of, how cubits behave and what you can do with kupets, that is quantum information.'], ['Now, what decoherence means is sort of unwanted interaction between, your cubists, the state of your quantum computer and the external environment.', 'So if noise is currently the biggest problem for quantum computing and then the dream is er correcting quantum computers', 'So the fundamental problem, if you are trying to actually build a quantum computer, of any appreciable size is something called decoherence.', 'And so what this means is that if i want to do a quantum computation, i have to keep the kupets sort of fanatically, well, isolated from their environment.', 'Ok, but, from the perspective of someone who is just looking at this cubitt, it is as though it has lost its quantum state.'], ['And the upshot of that theory is that if i want to build a reliable quantum computer and scale it up to, an arbitrary number of as many cubits as i want and doing as much on them as i want, i do not actually have to get the kupets perfectly isolated from their environment.', 'The goal has been to engineer cubits that are not perfectly reliable, but reliable enough that you can then use these error correcting codes to have them simulate tubists that are even more reliable than they are right to.', 'And then once you reach that sort of crossover point, then your simulated cubits could in turn simulate cubits that are even more reliable and so on until you have just, effectively you have arbitrarily reliable cubans.', 'The information that i care about in very clever ways across the collective states of multiple cubits in such a way that even if a small percentage of my cubits leak, well, i am constantly monitoring them to see if that leak happened.', 'Now, what changed the views of most of us was a profound discovery in the mid to late 90s, which was called the theory of quantum error correction and quantum fault tolerance.'], ['So so the way i would say it is that error correction imposes an overhead in the number of cubits, and that is actually one of the biggest practical problems with building a scalable quantum computer.', 'Where even with a non error corrected quantum computer with, these noisy devices, we can do something that is hard for classical computers to simulate.', 'You know, we are now entering the very early vacuum tube era of quantum computers.', 'Then conceivably they could just, build a an error corrected quantum computer as it was envisioned back in the 90s.', 'So at that point, you are talking about millions of physical cubists and some sense that is the reason why quantum computers are not breaking cryptography already.'], ['And and quantum supremacy just refers to sort of the point in history when you can first use a quantum computer to do some well defined task, much faster than any known algorithm running on any of the classical computers that are available.', 'You know, we know that moore’s law has to end.', ', uh, i really do mean we know that it cannot continue indefinitely because you will reach fundamental limits on how small you can possibly make a processor.', 'You know, we do not we sort of have not found a better alternative to quantum computational.', 'You know, if you were doing if you tried to build a computer that operated at ten to the forty three hertz, so did ten to the forty three operations per second.'], ['You know, of your of the quantum store, a list of all the amplitudes, in the state of the quantum computer and then just, do some linear algebra to just update that state.', 'So it is not just an incidental, matter of hardware, but it is that, as you went to larger and larger inputs, the classical scaling would be exponential and the scaling for the quantum algorithm would only be polynomial.', 'And the reason why we know that is that a classical computer could always if it had no limits of time in memory, it could always just store the entire quantum state.', 'We want, first of all, the quantum computer to be much faster just in the literal sense of like number of seconds, just solving this, well-defined problem.', 'Secondly, we want it to be sort of, for a problem where we really believe that a quantum computer has better scaling behavior.'], ['Ok, and the realization that we came to was that if you just want to prove that a quantum computer is faster, and not do something useful with it, then there are huge advantages to sort of switching your attention from problems like factoring numbers that have a single right answer to what we call sampling problems.', 'But you could say quantum supremacy is already enough by itself to refute the skeptics who said a quantum computer will never outperform a classical computer for anything but one.', 'Well, to this computer involved a quantum state with two to the 50 power amplitudes and, a classical simulation, at least any that we know today would require keeping track of two to the fiftieth numbers.', 'So, i want, a real world, a real problem to get solved, let us say, by a quantum computer with 50 cubits or so.', 'A lot of the work that i, i and my students have been doing for the last decade, which was precisely about how do you demonstrate quantum supremacy using technologies that we thought would be available in the near future.'], ['And so my students and i and also the people at google, we are doing the experiment came up with statistical tests that you can apply to the outputs in order to try to verify what is, that at least that some hard problem is being solved.', 'And so those that were a little bit likelier, ok, all of the outputs are exponentially unlikely, but some are, let us say, two times or three times, unlikelier than others.', 'Do it, it turns out that with a quantum computer, even with the noisy quantum computers that we have now that we have today, what you can do is basically just apply a randomly chosen sequence of operations.', 'You know, there are there was a little bit more destructive interference in their amplitude.', 'So we can repeat the exact same random sequence of interactions again and get another sample from that same distribution.'], ['And then when you get to larger numbers of cubits, then, these types of sampling experiments will no longer be so interesting because we will not even be able to verify the results', 'But for those you calculate with your classical computer, the probabilities that they should have been output and you see are those probability is like larger than the mean.', 'So with it, with the sampling thing, so the tests that google applied were this linear across entropy benchmark was basically just take the samples that were generated, which are, a very small subset of all the possible samples that there are.', 'That is enough that, the biggest classical computers on earth will have to sweat, and we will just barely, be able to keep up with the quantum computer.', ', how do we know that a classical computer could not have quickly done the same thing?'], ['Ok, so the famous discovery of peter shaw, twenty six years ago that really started quantum computing, as an autonomous field was that if you built a full scale quantum computer, then you could use it to efficiently find the prime factors of huge numbers and calculate discrete logarithms and solve a few other problems that are very, very special and character.', 'The first is that quantum supremacy, the milestone that google just achieved, is very, very far from the kind of scalable quantum computer that would be needed to actually threaten public key cryptography.', 'And so we were able to give some reduction evidence for the hardness of simulating these sampling experiments, the sampling based quantum supremacy experiments, the reduction evidence is not as satisfactory as it should be.', 'For even simulating quantum mechanics and for, simulating experiments like these, but we can give some evidence against that possibility and that was sort of the, the main thrust of a lot of the work that my colleagues and i did, over the last decade, which is then sort of in around 20, 15 or so.', 'It is also, we have a bunch of methods that are known for simulating quantum circuits or quantum computations with classical computers.'], ['The the big by the way, the biggest practical application of quantum computing that we know about by far, i think is simply the simulation of quantum mechanics itself in order to, learn about chemical reactions, design, maybe new chemical processes, new materials, new drugs, new solar cells, new superconductors, all kinds of things like that.', 'You know, we had actually recently a really, a super exciting candidate for an exponential quantum speed up for a machine learning problem that people really care about.', 'So next year in the us is holding a competition to create standards for post quantum cryptography, which will be the first step in trying to get every web browser and every router to upgrade, and use something like ssl that is would be based on what we think is quantum secure cryptography.', 'People are going to be racing over the next decade to try to do useful quantum simulations, even with, 100 or 200 cubic quantum computers of the sort that we expect to be able to build over the next decade.', 'And so with quantum computing, i would say that the main way that people go astray is by, not focusing on sort of the question of, are you getting a speed up over a classical computer or not?']], 'entis': [['Scott Aaronson', 'PERSON'], ['UT Austin',

alexa, which is sufficiently complex that you can introspect on how it works, starts giving you signs of consciousness through natural language that there is a feeling there is another entity there

or eggs or milk more cheaply, using them in some research.', 'So i think something analogous, not completely identical, but something analogous goes on and has gone on for a very long time with the

non-zero probability that will happen tomorrow, that how do you deal with these kinds of existential risks, like from nuclear war, from nuclear weapons, from biological weapons, from i am not sure of global warming falls into that category because global warming is a lot more gradual.', 'My disagreement with some of these people who talk about long term risks, extinction risk is only about how much priority that should have as compared to present questions such that if you look at the math of it from a utilitarian perspective, if it is existential risks, everybody dies, that it feels like an infinity in the math equation, that.', 'And people say it is not an existential risk because they will always be possibilities of some humans existing from antarctica or northern siberia or something of that sort.', 'You know, people in 80 years in the future would be in a much better position to say this is what we need to do to prevent this happening than we are now.', 'And therefore, even if the risk of extinction is very small, if we can reduce that risk, that is something that we ought to do.'], ['Utilitarianism is the ethical view that the right thing to do is the act that has the greatest expected utility, where what that means is it is the act that will produce the best consequences discounted by the odds that you will not be able to produce those consequences, that something will go wrong.', 'The beautiful thing with nick’s arguments is he quickly jumps from the individual scale to the universal scale, which is just all inspiring to think right when you think about the entirety of the span of the time of the universe.', 'Is in some way comparable to the sufferings or deaths of people who do exist at some point, and it is not clear to me, i think there is a case for saying that, but i also think there is a case for taking the other view.', 'Certainly the classical utilitarians think that by best consequences, we are talking about happiness and the absence of pain and suffering.', 'There are other consequentialist who are not really utilitarians, who say there are different things that could be good consequences, justice, freedom, human dignity, knowledge, they all of good consequences, too.'], ['So when i think about the worst experience is possible and the best experience possible, i do not think of them as equidistant from neutral.', 'I think it is possible that gets overridden by benefits to very large numbers of individuals.', 'But before we conclude that is the right answer, we have to know how severe the suffering is and how that compares with the benefits.', 'So i. i tend to think that extreme suffering.', 'And one way we have to focus on the short term consequences because we just can not really predict all of the longer term ramifications.'], ['And i think you ought to give priority to those who are worse off, even though i acknowledge that the gains that the worse off for making are less than the gains that those who are sort of medium badly off could be making.', 'So it is a scale that goes from minus 100 through zero is a neutral level to plus 100, because i know that i would not exchange an hour of my most pleasurable experiences for an hour of my most painful experiences.', 'You should aggregate and the result will be, even though it violates our intuitions of justice and fairness, whatever it might be, giving priority to those who are worse off at some point, i still think that will be the right thing to do.', 'I think it is difficult would be difficult to get converge towards agreement, at least at present, because some people would say, i have got different views about justice', 'If you really could calculate that, do you think it is possible to converge towards an agreement amongst humans towards an objective function, which is just a hopeless pursuit?'], ['And i hope that they will vote for policies, policies that reduce the suffering of animals and reduce the suffering of distant humans, whether geographically distant or distant, because they are future humans.', 'Well, so you also discuss the fact that altruism, which is a mechanism for going around government, for putting the power in the hands of the people to donate money towards causes to help, remove the middleman and give it directly to the causes they care about.', 'Politically, i am still a democrat, despite looking at the flaws in democracy and why it does not work always very well, so i do not see a better option than allowing the public to vote for governments in accordance with their policies.', 'You know, that is why, as i say, i do not know that we have a better system than democracy to make these decisions.', 'And in a sense, you could imagine a wise and benevolent, omni benevolent leader who would do that better than democracy could.'], ['Extreme suffering is an example and other things like objectively good, like having a rich, fulfilling, enjoyable, pleasurable life, and we can try to do our part in reducing the bad things and increasing the good things.', 'And they range from, for example, going to work on wall street so that you can earn a huge amount of money and then donate most of it to effective charities to going to work for a really good non-profit organization so that you can directly use your skills and ability and hard work to further a good because or perhaps going into politics.', 'The main thing i want to do in the book is to make people realize that it is not difficult to help people in extreme poverty, that there are highly effective organizations now that are doing this, that they have been independently assessed and verified by research teams that are expert in this area and that it is a fulfilling thing to do to for at least part of your life.', 'So one way the meaning is to do a little bit more of the good things, objectively good things, and a little bit less of the bad things.', 'You know, we can not all be saints, but at least one of your goals should be to really make a positive contribution to the world and to do something to help people who, through no fault of their own, are in very dire circumstances and

robot, if the robot has a human brain, is actually not that large.', 'There was a little video that i think robotics researchers really like to show a special robotics learning researchers like myself from 2004 from stanford, which demonstrates a prototype robot called the pr one.', 'And there is also a really big gap between capabilities of robots in terms of hardware and their physical capability and capabilities of robots in terms of what they can do autonomously.', 'And when you say hardware, you are referring to the physical side of the actual body of the robot, as opposed to the hardware on which the cognition, the nerves, the hardware of the nervous system.'], ['But if you are actually interacting with the world and essentially performing the sort of hard negative mining by attempting what you think might work, observing the sometimes happy and sometimes sad outcomes of that and augmenting your understanding using that experience, and you are just doing this continually for many years, maybe that sort of data in some sense is actually much more favorable to obtain a common sense understanding.', 'One reason we might think that this is true is that, the what we associate with common sense or lack of common sense is often characterized by the ability to reason about kind of counterfactual questions if i were to hear this bottle of water sitting on the table, everything is fine for knock it over, which i am not going to do.', 'I think that for modern machine learning, it is actually a really big challenge to take this unstructured, massive experience and distill out something that looks like a common sense understanding of the world.', 'Or does it actually matter whether your machine physically experiences the world or in the sense that it actually attempts things, observes the outcome of its actions and kind of augments experience that way that it chooses which parts of the world it gets to interact with and observe and learn from?', 'I see what you are painting, an optimistic, beautiful picture, especially from the robotics perspective, because that means we just need to invest and build better learning algorithms to figure out how we can get access to more and more data for those learning algorithms to extract signals from and then accumulate that iceberg of knowledge.'], ['But i think that there is a second answer and that answer the answer is a lot closer to why i want to work on robotics, which is that i think it is less about what it would take to do a really good job in the world of robotics, but', 'But if i have a bad understanding of the world, i might think that is a good way for me to gain more utility if i actually go about my daily life doing the things that my current understanding of the world suggests will give me high utility.', 'Yes, i think that is the dream for many people who actually work in this space, i think that there is something very pragmatic and very useful about studying robotics.', 'That is kind of a very pragmatic view of what it would take to kind of solve the robotics problem of the world.', 'One of the big differences between sort of the classic formulation of a reinforcement learning problem and some of the sort of more open ended reformulations of that problem that have been explored in recent years.'], ['So we had, back in 2014, we had some work, basically our first work on end and reinforcement learning for robotic manipulation skills from vision, which, at the time was something that seemed a little inflammatory and controversial in the robotics world.', 'The notion of input, output and supervision is much, much cleaner, so computer vision, for example, deals with very complex inputs, but it is comparatively a bit easier, at least up to some level of abstraction, to cast it as a very tightly supervised problem.', 'So the the is more of a paradox is probably referring to the space of the physical interaction, like you said, object manipulation, walking, all the kind of stuff we do in the physical world that.', 'If we look at sort of the sub spaces of robotics that, again, as you said, robotics integrates all of them together, then we will get to see how this beautiful mess interplays.', 'And it is not that we need to make machines better or worse at math and better our drinking water, but just that by studying those discrepancies, we might find some new insight so that there could be in any space.'], ['So people who have studied the history of computer vision will find this very familiar, that kind of in the same way that in the early days of computer vision, people thought of it very much like an inverse graphics thing in robotic grasping.', 'Do you ever just who can zoom in as we talk about robotics to have a canonical problem, sort of a simple, clean, beautiful representative problem in robotics that you think about when you are thinking about some of these problems?', 'It just needs to figure out where it is distributing the errors in such a way that the horizontal difference matters more than the vertical difference, because vertically just pushes it down all the way until it can not go any further and their perceptual errors are a lot less harmful.', 'But actually since then, people have gotten really good at building systems to solve this problem to the point where i am not actually sure how much more progress we can make with that as like the main guiding thing.', 'If you agree that maybe you zoom in some particular aspect of that problem, that you just like if we solve that problem perfectly, it will unlock a major step in towards human level intelligence.'], ['The bits that will because the thing to pivot and bend and drop out of your hand versus the bits that result in a nice, secure grasp, things that are flexible, things that if you pick them up the wrong way, they will fall upside down and the contents will spill out.', 'You pick up the thing and it turns out that works really well for a body grasping instantiated in many different recent works, including our own, but also ones from many other labs, is to use learning methods with some combination of either exhaustive simulation or like actual real world trial and error.', 'Yeah, it is a difficult problem because the number of things that you might have to deal with or the variety of things you have to deal with is extremely large.', 'The general problem of robotics requires common sense reasoning, requires general intelligence, this kind of human level capability of.', 'It has to do with, the bits that are easier to pick up, the bits that are harder to pick up, the bits are more flexible.'], ['One way to think about common sense is that and why our current systems might lack common sense is that common sense is a property is an emergent property of actually having to interact with a particular world, a particular universe, and get things done in that universe.', 'And then you can easily construct situations where image capturing systems do things that defy common sense, like give it a picture of a person wearing a fur coat and we will say it is a teddy bear.', 'But let me ask, what learning can the general sort of robotics, the epitome of robotics problem be solved purely through learning perhaps, and to end learning?', 'And for some reason, i do not know if i am my way of thinking is common, but i thought, we need to understand and solve intelligence in order to solve robotics.', 'And if we build a systems that are forced to deal with all of the messiness and complexity of our universe, maybe they will have to acquire common sense to essentially maximize their utility.'], ['So i think that is a good point, that one big difference between learning based systems and classic optical control systems is that learning based systems in principle should get better and better the more they do something.', 'What do you think that will have a role as simple as the, deep learning, machine learning, reinforcement learning has been has shown incredible results and breakthroughs and just inspired thousands, maybe millions of researchers.', 'An overly sharp dichotomy, i think that in some ways when we build algorithms, we, at some point a person does something like that person or there is always a person turned on the computer, a person, implemented tensor flow.', 'But with especially deep learning that the accumulation sort of experiences in data form to form deep representations starts to feel like knowledge as opposed to optimal control', 'So i look back at the world of expert systems, a symbolic a.i. and so on, of using logic to accumulate expertise, human expertise, human encoded expertise.'], ['And that provided sort of a boost to what we are really still essentially a logical inference systems, just probabilistic logical inference systems.', 'What that turned into somewhere in the 1990s is, well, instead of building kind of predicates and statements that have true or false values will build probabilistic systems where things have probabilities associated and probabilities of being true and false and that to business.', 'Maybe on that topic, do you have a hope that sort of inferences of learning based systems will be as explainable as the dream was with expert systems, for example?', 'But if i were to sort of psychoanalyze the researchers at the time, i would say expert systems connected to that part that deserve our research for systems to be explainable.', 'You have a model of the world that just happens to be expressed by a neural net and you are doing some inference procedure, some sort of manipulation on that model to figure out, the answer to a query that you have is the interprete ability.'], ['The the basic question, you are one of the world class researchers and reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning, certainly in the robotic space, what is reinforcement learning?', 'I think it is a very complicated question because i think that in some ways the question of explain ability is kind of very closely tied to the question of like performance.', 'But then one of the things that jacob did is he treated that sentence not as a command from a person, but as a representation of the internal kind of state of the mind of this policy, essentially, so that when he was faced with a new task, what it would do is it would basically try to think of possible language descriptions, attempt to do them and see if they led to the right outcome.', 'Jacob actually works on natural language processing, but he had this idea to do a little bit of work and reinforcement learning and how natural language can basically structure the internals of policies, train with rl.', 'The convincing ness of the story becoming part of the reward function, the objective function is to explain ability.'], ['And one of the really appealing things about reinforcement learning is if it does encapsulate the range of all these decision-making problems, perhaps working on reinforcement learning is, one of the ways to reach a very broad swath of a.i. problems.', 'So maybe down the line everything will be a reinforcement learning problem, just like you said in the image classification should be mapped to reinforcement learning problem.', 'So one of the reasons why it is a bit difficult today to use reinforcement learning for all the things that we might want to use it for is that in most of the settings where we want to do rational decision-making, it is a little bit tough to just deploy some policy that does crazy stuff and learns purely through trial and error.', 'So classically, reinforcement learning has a much more narrow definition, which is that it is literally learning from reinforcement, like the thing does something', 'You can certainly cast supervised learning as a reinforcement learning problem.'], [\"So if you have a purely on policy kind of online process, then you ask these what if questions, you make some mistakes, then you go and try doing those mistake and things, and then you observe kind of the counterexamples that'll teach you not to do those things again.\", 'So model based methods answer a question of what state you would get, basically what would happen to the world if you were to take a certain action value based methods.', 'Now, unfortunately for us, with current machine learning methods, answering, what if questions can be really hard because they are really questions about things that did not happen.', 'If you have a bunch of off policy data and you just want to synthesize the best policy you can out of that data, then you really have to deal with the challenges of making these counterfactual.', 'If you want to answer what if questions about things that did happen, you would not need to learn model.'], ['But if you got the data by actually acting in the world based on what your current policy thinks is good, we call that on policy data and obviously on policy data is more useful to you, because if your current policy makes some bad decisions, you will actually see that those decisions are bad.', 'So if you get your data from somebody else who was doing some other stuff, maybe you get your data from some manually programmed system that was, just running in the world before, that is before it goes off policy data.', 'Yeah, so the terms on policy and off policy refer to how you get your data.', 'Off policy data, however, might be much easier to obtain because maybe that is all the log of data that you have from before.', 'So we talk about offline, talked about autonomous vehicles that you can envision off policy that kind of approaches in robotics spaces where there is already a ton of robots out there, but they do not get the luxury of being able to explore based on a reinforcement learning framework.'], ['Because what you are really dealing with is situations where you have a model statistical model that is trying to make predictions about things that i had not seen before.', 'So you could figure out that all this action my model is telling me that it is great, but it looks totally different from any action i have taken.', 'So that is why i am pretty excited about that problem, because i think that we are in a position where we can make some real progress on it just by coming up with the right algorithms in terms of which algorithms that could be.', 'And you can incorporate regularization terms into your learning objective that will essentially tell you not to ask those questions that your model is unable to answer.', 'And, this is something that i think it is great because inelegance question is, that just takes some very smart people to get together and think about it really hard.'], ['And one of those fields actually reinforcement learning because in reinforcement learning, the notion of features, if you do not use neural nets and you have to design your own features is very, very opaque.', 'Well, deep reinforcement learning simply refers to taking reinforcement learning algorithms and combining them with high capacity neural net representations, which is, kind of it might at first seem like a pretty arbitrary thing.', 'This is, it is something that feels perhaps kind of obvious if you just hear the term reinforcement learning or you think about trial and error learning.', 'And maybe taking a step back, not just now, but what is to use the most beautiful idea, apologize for the romanticized question, but the beautiful idea or concept in reinforcement learning?', 'Well, i think it makes sense when you take some time to think about it, but it is a little surprising or then taking a step into the more deeper representations, which is also very surprising to sort of the richness of the state space, the space of environments that this kind of approach can operate in.'], ['Like, i guess my question is, is it surprising to you how far the deep side of deep reinforcement learning is able to like what the space of problems has been able to tackle from especially in games with the alpha star and alpha zero and just the representation power there and in the robotics space.', 'It is because when you try to actually do trial and error, learning reinforcement, learning directly in the real world where you have the potential to gather these large, highly varied and complex data sets, you start running into other problems, like one problem you run into very quickly.', 'But the fact that neural networks are able to discover features in the control problem, it is very interesting.', 'So like the reason that i can not get my robot to learn how to, i do not know, do the dishes in the kitchen, it is not because it is neural net is not big enough.', 'It will first sound like a very pragmatic problem, but actually turns out to be a pretty deep scientific problem.'], ['So there are all sorts of things like this that sort of come up when we think through what we really need to get reinforcement learning to happen at scale in the real world.', 'Perhaps what it really needs to do is have an existence, a lifetime where it does many things and the previous things that it has done, prepare it to do new things more efficiently.', 'There are other things that are that can also be categorized as kind of scaffolding, but are very important, for example, where you get your reward function if i want to learn how to pour a cup of water.', 'And many of these things actually suggest a little bit of a shortcoming in the problem formulation and a few deeper questions that we have to resolve.', 'And, the study of these kinds of questions typically falls under categories like multitask, learning or metal learning.'], ['So i think that actually the kind of problems that come up when we want systems that are reliable and that can kind of understand the limits of their capabilities, they are actually very similar to the kind of problems that come up when we have when we are doing off policy reinforcement learning.', 'So as i mentioned before, and also reinforcement learning, the big problem is, when you can trust the predictions of your model, because if you are trying to evaluate some pattern of behavior for which your model does not give you an accurate prediction, then you should not use that to modify your policy.', 'So what do you think about if you just look at one particular case study of tesla autopilot that has quickly approaching towards a million vehicles on the road where some percentage of the time, 30, 40 percent of the time is driving using the computer vision multitask high.', 'But they all fundamentally deal with the same general theme, which is use experience for doing other things to learn to do new things efficiently and quickly.', 'And it is actually very similar to the problem that we are faced when we actually then deploy that thing and we want to decide whether we trust it in the moment or not.'], ['But do you think we can ever get rid of simulation or do you think simulation will actually take over, will create more and more realistic simulations that will allow us to solve actual real world problems like transfer the models will learn simulation tomorrow?', 'That is interesting question for reinforcement learning, too, because if we want to make sufficiently realistic simulations that make it blend the difference between sort of the real world and the simulation, thereby just some of the things we have been talking about, kind of the problems go away if we can create actually interesting rich simulations.', 'The reason i think the simulation hypothesis is interesting is it is to think about how difficult is it to create sort of a virtual reality game type situation that will be sufficiently convincing to us humans or sufficiently enjoyable that we would not want to leave?', 'And this is, by the way, this is something that i think is quite relevant now, especially in the context of some of the things we have discussed, because some of these kind of scaffolding issues that i mentioned, things like the broken dishes and the unknown reward function like these are not problems that you would ever stumble on when working in a purely simulated kind of environment.', 'So, for example, if you think about how people tried to figure out biology and medicine, for the longest time, the kind of rules, the kind of principles that serve us very well in our day to day lives actually serve us very poorly in understanding medicine and biology.'], ['And we are still learning sort of these competitive creating a competitive context in which agents can play against each other in a sort of at the same skill level and thereby increasing each other’s skill level.', 'And you are completely right that classically in reinforcement learning, this question has kind of been treated as a non-issue, that you sort of treat the reward as the external thing that comes from some other bit of your biology and you do not worry about it.', 'So the reason that self play works for a board game is because the rules of that board game mediate the interaction between the agents.', 'But i suspect that the bottleneck to actually generalizing it to the robotic setting is actually going to be the same as the bottleneck for everything else that we need to be able to build machines that can get better and better through natural interaction with the world.', 'Seems to be the thing that we associate with generally like human beings seem to value the idea of developing our own reward functions of, arriving at meaning'], ['Enter situations that have low probability under the distribution of states you have seen before, it turns out that is actually one very good way to do a positive reinforcement learning, actually, so we can do something like that if we slowly venture in speaking about reward functions into greater and greater levels of intelligence.', 'Is there a role for a human notion of curiosity in itself being the reward, sort of discovering new things about the world, the world?', 'One of the things we have studied is whether we can have some notion of sort of unsupervised reinforcement learning by means of, information theoretic quantities, for instance, minimizing a bayesian measure of surprise.', 'So one of the things that i am pretty interested in is actually whether discovering new things can actually be an emergent property of some other object of the quantifiers capability.', 'You mean just a curious observation to see sort of creative patterns of curiosity on the way to optimize for particular on the way to optimize for a particular measure of capability?'], ['Automated general methods plus data leads to good results, then it makes sense that we should build general methods and we should build the kind of methods that we can deploy and get them to go out there and collect their experience autonomously.', 'Machine learning systems in some ways have revealed to us the ethical flaws in our data in that same kind of work and reinforcement learning.', 'It is just i think right now the bottleneck for improving reliability, safety and things like that is more with systems that need to work better, that need to optimize their objective better.', 'I think that one place where i think that the current state of things falls a little bit short of that', 'I do not know if you looked at the blog post bitter lesson by eva sutton, where it looks at sort of the big lesson of research in the eye and in learning is that simple methods, gentle methods that leverage computation seem to work well.'], ['What do i want to see a robot do what i want to do and what i want to see a natural language system which is like imagine, imagine it almost like a commercial for a future product or something or like something that you would like to see in the world and then actually sit down and think about the steps that are necessary to get there.', 'It is to not be afraid to spend time imagining the kind of outcome that you might like to see, so, one outcome might be a successful career, a large paycheck or something, or state of the art result in some benchmark.', 'And then naturally to turn to you, we have talked about reward functions and you just given advice and looking forward, how would you like to see what kind of change you would like to make in the world?', 'Or they hit a wall because they rely on a label data set, but they never hit the wall of, running out of stuff to see like that.', 'And i think that thinking about that and then backtracking from there and imagining the steps needed to get there will actually lead to much better research.']], 'entis': [['Sergei

are doing it without the individual people being aware that there is others.', 'So i spent the summer of 66 working on that, had a great time, meant a lot of really nice people.', 'But fundamentally,

conversation with jitendra malik, a professor at berkeley and one of the seminal figures in the field of computer vision, the kind before the deep learning revolution and the kind after.', 'I think express vpn is the best vpn out there.'], ['So in the human vision literature, there used to be these terms, sensation, perception and cognition, which is roughly speaking referred to the front end of processing, middle stages of processing and higher level of processing.', 'I wonder if this unique division that it seems that language people are not so confident about, some natural language processing people are a little bit more cautious about our ability to solve their problem.', 'I think the high levels of the problem called the cognitive levels of the problem are there.', 'As far as we know, to tell students to work on and solve that summer, so that proposal outlined many of the computer vision task we still work on today, what do you think?', 'But it seems strange that as computer vision researchers, for example, the community broadly is time and time again makes the mistake of thinking the problem is easier than it is.'], ['So one of the companies in the space, tesla, is with carpathia and elon musk, are working on a system called autopilot, which is primarily a vision based system with eight cameras and basically a single neural network, a multitask neural network.', 'So where do you think most of the difficult cases to me, even the highway driving is an open problem because it applies the same 50, 90, 95, 99 rule or the first step, the fallacy of the first step.', 'So the way i think about it is that there are certainly subset subsets of the visual base driving problem, which are quite solvable.', 'Do you think driving can be converted in this way to a purely a vision problem and solved within with learning?', 'Is quite a solvable problem, i think there were demonstrations of that going back to the 1980s by someone called on statements in munich in the 90s, there were protests from carnegie mellon.'], ['But i think our current systems, a computer vision systems that need far, far more data than humans do for learning the same capabilities to say that there is going to be a system that solves autonomous driving.', 'Yeah, i include that in vision because to me, perception blends into cognition and building predictive models of other agents in the world, which could be other agents, could be people that agents could be out there, because that is part of the task of perception.', 'So what might have been the correct behavior for a pedestrian, a typical behavior where pedestrian was not the typical behavior for a skateboard?', 'Then like the middle ground, i do not know if you put that under vision, which is trying to predict the behavior of others, which is a little bit in the world of understanding the scene.', 'We fall victim to i think even highway driving has a lot of elements because this all the time is driving.'], ['What we have found currently very effective in computer vision, in the deep learning paradigm is sort of tabula rasa learning and tabula rasa learning in a supervised way with lots and lots of tabula rasa.', 'And do you think the learning mechanisms we have today can do that kind of long term accumulation of knowledge, or do we have to do some kind of, the work that led up to expert systems with knowledge representation?', 'So if you look at the computer vision conferences and the work that is been going on, it is often separate into different little segments, breaking the problem of vision apart into other segmentation, 3d reconstruction, object detection, i do not know, image capturing, whatever.', 'I think i do not see any in principle the problem with neural networks doing it, but i think the learning techniques would need to evolve significantly.', 'Now if let us think about human driving, it is not tabula rasa learning.'], ['And so today we have what seems like a fairly general-purpose capability, which can look at the external world and building a model of the external world inside the head.', 'You kind of jokingly said about spending, but perhaps the capitalistic drive that drives a lot of the development in this world is about the exchange of money in the fundamental action is money.', 'Ok, so to linger on the division between the static and the dynamic, so much of the work in computer vision, so many of the breakthroughs that you have been a part of have been in the static world in looking at static images.', 'And psychologists have great fun in pointing out the ways in which the model in your head is not a perfect model of the external world.', 'So as a guiding general statement of a problem, do you think we can say that the general problem of computer vision?'], ['The into sort of the trivial first chances of course, one image is harder, but if you look at a deeper question, there are we what is the term cutting ourselves, cutting ourselves at the knees or like making the problem harder by focusing on images?', 'If you are a university researcher, i think video computing is not so challenging if you are at google or facebook or amazon, still super challenging.', 'So so think of these choices or one of the choices is focusing on single images rather than video.', 'Do you think do you think some kind of injection of knowledge bases and reasoning is required to help improve like action recognition?', 'Now, video is still under study because video computer is still quite challenging.'], ['I think the kinds of technology that we have right now with 3d convolutions over a couple of seconds, clip of video, it is very much tailored towards short term video understanding, not that long term understanding.', 'So the way i would say it is that perception blends into cognition and cognition brings in issues of memory and this notion of a schema for from psychology, which is let me use the classic example, which is you go to a restaurant right now.', 'What kind of tests for computer vision do you think we should have that mimic the child’s in computer vision?', 'So that is a really interesting point, and if i think about the benchmarks we have before us, that the tests of our computer vision systems are often kind of trying to get to the adult.', 'So i think that when we are going to do long form video understanding, we are going to need to do this.'], ['And i think the part of that, the challenges that we should really be collecting data of the type that a child that the child experiences.', 'So if we could collect that kind of data and then develop learning schemes based on that data, that would be one way to do it.', 'But there are attempts in this direction to sort of try to collect the kind of data that a child encounters growing up.', 'So the child gets to play with the data set.', 'So one of the fundamental aspects of learning like a child is the interactivity.'], ['And facebook, our research group has worked on something called habitat, which is a simulation environment, which is a visually photorealistic environment of, places like houses or interiors of various urban spaces and so forth.', 'So i like the part that i like about that is the scientist wants to do wants to build causal models and the scientist does control experiments.', 'One reason why i think this act of being able to act in the world is important.', 'And i think that we could achieve it and in two ways, and i think we should use both.', 'And one of the ways in which one of our most reliable ways of establishing causal links and this the way, for example, that the medical community does this is randomized control trials.'], ['You break vision apart into in one of your presentations, the early vision static’s in understanding dynamics, your understanding and raise a few interesting questions.', 'There are several companies which are trying to use some of these more advanced neural network type techniques for compression, both for static images as well as for video.', 'And i think that is all the success of that area about image statistics and video statistics.', 'So i think, of course, some of that is very computer intensive, but i think by and by we will find ways of making our models ever more realistic.', 'I do not see any fundamental problem that look, the computer graphics community has come a long way so that in the early days back, going back to the 80s and 90s'], ['The way that computer vision folks have all agreed is very important of drawing out lines around objects versus a bounding box or and then classifying that object.', 'That some set of pig cells are an object without necessarily even being able to name that object or annoying properties of that object.', 'So in biology, what we know is that the processes in test time at runtime, those processes are not purely feed forward, but they involve feedback.', 'So for people who do not know computer vision segmentation, is this weird activity.', 'And i would rather have a bit of both and at both stages for all computer vision problems, not just segmentation.'], ['So recognition is the easiest one, because that is what i think people generally think of as computer vision achieving these days, which is labels.', 'And you think of segmentation as this kind of task that takes on a visual scene and breaks it apart into interesting entities.', 'But we make these entities, we create these entities, objects, whatever you want to call the relationship between the entities, as well as a purely about the entities.', 'I think the mistake that we used to make in the early days of computer vision was to treat it as a purely bottom up perceptual task.', 'And i think understanding that all the pictures of a human are one entity is actually quite a challenge because the parts of the human eye, they can move independently and the human wears clothes.'], ['And if people divided up vision into various models, the way they would do it is as low level, mid-level and high level vision corresponding roughly to the psychologist', 'Ok, so therefore, i try to promote this particular framework as a way of considering the problems that people in computer vision were actually working on and trying to be more explicit about the fact that they actually are connected to each other.', 'This problem of computer vision, of organization recognition can be a reconstruction, how much of it can be learned and do you think sort of set it and forget it?', 'Something like that, because at that time in computer vision, that distinction that people were just working on many different problems,', 'Now, it turns out in the last five years or so in the post, that deep learning revolution that there is this architecture has turned out to be very conducive to that, because basically in these neural networks, we are trying to build multiple representations.'], ['So i, i think that currently what that end to end learning means nowadays is end to end supervised learning.', 'I would i like this child development view, this lifelong learning view, one where there are certain capabilities that are built up', 'End to end learning in the supervised setting for a very precise task to me, is it kind of as a sort of a limited view of the learning process?', 'I think tactile and visual, there is some work on there is a lot of work currently on audio and visual and audio visual.', 'Ok, but the child is learning something about the three dimensional world from this signal.'], ['So what is harder to pass the spirit of the turing test, like whatever formulation will make it a natural language convincingly in natural language, like somebody would want to have a beer with hang out and have a chat with or the general national scene understanding.', 'There will be there will be accomplishments which are visual accomplishments, accomplishments which are accomplishments and manipulation or robotics and then accomplishments in language.', 'I think i would not i do not think we should have created a single test of intelligence.', 'You think language is better than i think.', 'I think turing test that during, as he proposed a test in 1950, was trying to solve a certain problem imitations.'], ['I think that tasks which are the tasks in the manipulation domain tasks and navigation tasks and visualising understanding tasks and under reading a story and answering questions based on that, so my favorite language understanding task would be, reading a novel and being able to answer arbitrary questions from it.', 'So david hilbert in 1900 proposed 23 open problems in mathematics, some of which are still unsolved, most important, famous of which is probably the riemann hypothesis you have thought about and presented about the help of problems of computer vision.', 'So on the visual understanding side, in this intelligence olympics that we have set up, what is a good test for one of many of visual scene understanding?', 'So what today are the hilberg problems of computer vision, do you think?', 'Ok, i think i would rather have a list of 10 different tasks.'], ['Are you ok or comfortable with neural networks that do achieve visual understanding, that do, for example, achieve this kind of 3d understanding and you do not know how they you do not know that you are not able to interest, but you are not able to visualize or understand or interact with the representation.', 'Then i will talk about understanding the world in 3-d that this may seem paradoxical because in a way, we have been able to do 3d understanding even like 30 years ago.', 'And these techniques are based on a supervised learning and they are based on having a training time, 3-d models of objects available.', 'But i do not think we currently have the richness of 3d understanding in our computer system that we would like because, uh.', 'Right, so now is the computer programs diagnosis based on data, which was data collected of four american males who are in their 30s and 40s and maybe not so relevant to me, maybe it is irrelevant, etc., cetera.'], ['As so, we ourselves are black boxes, but we are also those of us who are charming are able to convince others like explain the black, what is going on inside the black box with narratives or stories.', 'I am willing to sacrifice interpretive abilities that i believe that there can be systems which can be highly performant, but which are internally black boxes.', 'Some of the best performing systems are essentially black boxes fundamentally by their construction.', 'So we may have acquired statistics from one group of people and applying it to a different group of people who may not share all the same characteristics their data might have.', 'Do you think we will ever build a system of human level or super superhuman level intelligence?'], ['I, i think that, donald rumsfeld is not a favorite person of mine, but one of his lines is very good, which is about known knowns, known unknowns and unknown unknowns.', 'I think that it is not just a worry we need to have when we get that ajai, i think that a.i. is being used in many systems today and there might be settings, for example, when it causes biases or decisions which could be harmful.', 'I feel with respect to natural language understanding and high level cognition, it is not just known unknowns, but also unknown unknowns.', 'So i think with respect to a lot of what the case in vision and robotics, i feel like we have known unknowns.', 'Or we need to first allow the unknown unknowns to become known unknowns?'], [', i feel that i have been very lucky because i feel

on having an open mind, always questioning my assumptions and in general marvel at the immense mystery of everything around us and the limitations of at least my mind.'], ['And my department, department of nuclear science and engineering at mit is very concerned about all the interactions and reactions and consequences of things that go on in the nucleus, including nuclear energy, fission energy, which is the nuclear energy that we have already, and fusion energy, which is the energy source of the sun and stars, which we do not quite know how to turn into practical energy for humankind at the moment.', 'And the reason why my department is interested in plasma physics very strongly is because most things well, for one thing, most things in the universe are plasma.', 'Are essentially the fourth state of matter, so if you think about solid liquid gas, plasma is the fourth of those states of matter', 'And the sun are plasma tvs because they are very hot and it is only in very hot states that nuclear fusion reactions take place.', 'Maybe we need to draw a distinction between nuclear physics and plasma physics.'], ['It means that there are many nuclear particles in the nucleus itself, neutrons and protons in the nucleus itself, so that in the case of uranium, there are 92 protons in each nucleus and even more neutrons so that the total number of nuclear bonds in the nucleus, nuclear arms is short for either proton or a neutron.', 'So a chemical reaction means take hydrogen, take oxygen, react them together, let us say, and get water that releases energy, the energy released and the chemical reaction like that, or the burning of coal or on oil or whatever else is about a million times less per unit mass than what is released in nuclear reactions.', 'Well, taking light elements like isotopes of hydrogen and not breaking them up, but actually fusing them together, reacting them together to produce heavier elements, typically helium, which is helium, is a nucleus which has two protons and neutrons that also releases energy.', 'Light elements, by contrast, have very few nucleus protons and neutrons in the nucleus.', 'And that and that or reactions like that, making heavier elements from lighter elements is what mostly powers the sun and stars'], ['But it is much harder to do on earth than it is, in a star, because, we need temperatures of order, tens of millions of degrees celsius in order for the reactions to go fast enough to generate enough electricity to keep or enough energy to keep it going.', 'And how best we can confine these incredibly hot gases, plasmas using magnetic fields with the ultimate objective of releasing fusion energy on earth and, generating electricity with it and powering our society with it.', 'And the predominant attempt at making fusion work on earth is to use magnetic fields to confine the plasma.', 'And that is what we have got to do on earth if we are going to make fusion work on earth.', 'But if you are able to take the match away and they keep burning and they are generating enough heat to keep themselves hot and hence keep the reactions going, that is chemical ignition.'], ['The the big advantage of that is that plasma particles are when they are in a in the presence of a magnetic field, feel strong forces from the magnetic field.', 'Best prospect in the least in the near term for making fusion energy work is one in which there is a very strong magnetic field the long way round the doughnut around the taurus.', 'So on top of the magnetic fields, do you also need the plastic water bottle walls or is it purely magnetic fields?', 'So you have got to imagine that there is this doughnut shape with an embedded magnetic field just going round and round the long way.', 'Uh, so if we want to do it on earth where there is air, we want the plasma to consist of hydrogen isotopes or other things, the things we are trying to react.'], ['Well, if you make the magnetic field go inside this toroidal chamber and just simply go round and round the chamber, then because of this helical orbit, the particles can not move fast across the magnetic field, but they can move very quickly along the magnetic field.', 'And if you have a magnetic field that does not leave the chamber, it does not matter if they move along the magnetic field.', 'When those fusion reactions take place, energy is released, large amounts of energy is released in the form of particles.', 'The neutron carries out four fifths of the fusion energy and that will have to be captured in a blanket that surrounds the chamber in which we take the energy.', 'But if you just had a straight magnetic field, for example, coming from helmholtz coil or a bar magnet, then you would have to have ends.'], ['But it was not all that long after even the discovery of nuclear fission that fission reactors were built in fission reactors, of course, operated before we had weapons.', 'By contrast, fission energy efficient to build a fission reactor proved to be amazingly easy.', 'And that is that in fission, it is hard to turn the reactor off when you stop the nuclear reactions, there is still a lot of heat being liberated from the fission products.', 'And so we have nuclear energy today because fission reactors are relatively easy to build.', 'Enough uranium to support fission energy worldwide for thousands of years, but maybe not for millions of years.'], ['Because when you say the word nuclear, people do not instantly think about nuclear energy, they think about nuclear weapons.', 'And i think from everything and understand nuclear energy, fission based energy goes into that category.', 'I do not mean to say that fission energy is overwhelmingly problematic, but clearly there have been catastrophes associated with fission reactors.', 'So, in the scale of risks, one should take the view that are in my estimation that fission energy came out of that looking pretty good.', 'And yet the pr, whoever does the pr for nuclear energy is not has a hard job ahead of them at the moment.'], ['So the earliest nuclear weapons that the nuclear bombs that were dropped on japan, et cetera, et cetera, were pure fission weapons.', 'It was designed with the claim that it would reach ignition fusion ignition in this platform where the reactions have got over with so quickly before the whole thing flies apart, it did not actually reach ignition and it does not look as if it will, although we never know.', 'Fusion reactions because the fusion reactions give more energy per unit mass than fission reactions, and', 'So another approach to fusion, which actually is mostly researched in the weapons complex, the national labs and so forth, because it is more associated with the technologies of weapons is inertial fusion.', 'Explosion, which then sets off and compresses hydrogen isotopes and other things, which i do not know, because i do not i have never had a security clearance, ok, so i can not betray any secrets about weapons because i have never been party to them, but'], ['And therefore, i actually doubt that we can reach a level of energy of fossil energy use that is one percent of the current use in the west without totally dramatic changes, either in, our society, our use of energy and so forth, which actually causes much of that energy, is used for producing food and so on and so forth.', 'So if you have in mind some utopia in the future where we have reached a sustainable use of energy and we have also reached a situation in which there is far less inequity in the world in the sense that people have share the energy resources more uniformly, then what that is equivalent to would be to reduce the co2 emissions in western economies, not by a factor of 10, but by a factor of 100.', 'Technology’s in solved the challenges, society, the challenges, human choices, the challenges almost entirely human and sociological, not technology, not technology.', 'And when people talk about energy, they think that there is some kind of technological magic bullet for this.', 'What is more, the average energy consumption and hence co2 emission of people in the world is less than a tenth of what we pay per capita of than what we have in the west, in america and europe and so forth.'], ['Clearly god in the christian god, the god of abraham, isaac and jacob, et cetera, it is not any of those things because all of those things you just mentioned are phenomena or or.', 'Entities in the created world and the most fundamental thing about monotheism, as abraham and moses and so forth handed it down, is that god is not an entity within the creation within the universe, that god is the creator of it all.', 'It is certainly been the outlook of jews and christians throughout history that god is seen in the creation that we when we look at the creation, we see to some extent the wonder, the majesty, the might of the person or the entity, but the person.', 'And and so christians, myself included, believe that prayer is in a certain sense a connection with god.', 'As a christian, i believe that i have a relationship with god, which is best expressed by saying that it is personal.'], ['But the truth is that there are many ways of getting to know things in our world, know things reliably in our world, and a lot of them are not science.', 'And the purpose of that title is to draw attention to the fact that in our society as a whole, in particularly in the west today, we have grown so reliant on science that we tend to put aside other ways of getting to know things.', 'The short answer is that by scientism, we mean the belief that science is all the real knowledge there is.', 'Who created it and that is a way in which scientists particularly have over the ages and certainly over most of the last five centuries since the scientific revolution, scientists have seen in a certain sense the hand of god in creation.', 'But it is remarkable to me how influential christianity and religion in general has been in science, most of the sciences through history, as you described.'], ['But it is certainly the case that many of the arguments, in fact, most of the arguments of the aggressive atheists of this century, people are sometimes called new atheists, although they are actually rather old.', ', some is history, some sociology, economics, politics, philosophy, art, history, language, literature, etc., etc.', 'I do not even know what atheist or atheist is, but is it possible for somebody to be an atheist and avoid slipping into scientism?', 'You know, history is full of unique events.', 'The uniqueness is anyway unique events, unique events.'], ['Maybe you can help us by way of therapy to understand, um, because you have kind of said that there is other ways of knowing what about if we if i kind of sit here and am cognizant of the fact that i almost do not know anything, sort of i am sitting here almost paralyzed by the mystery of it all.', 'Like if we look even one hundred years from now, when people look back to this time, humans look back to this time, they will probably laugh at how little we knew even a hundred years from now.', 'I just do not even know where to begin because it just feels like we know so little.', 'And i think there are other important ways of getting to know things.', 'Not not simply because in the future we will know more science and there will be more powerful ways of finding out about things.'], ['Well, i think faith is very often misunderstood in our society at the moment because it is often portrayed as being nothing other than believing things are not true, or believing things that are not proven ok.', 'Faith also means, trusting in something, trusting in a person or trusting in a thing, the reliability of some technology, for example, that is equally part of the meaning of the word faith.', 'And actually, in terms of the christian faith, christians are far more called to trust and loyalty than they are to belief in things they do not, do not have proof of.', 'There there is a sense in which everybody has to live their lives are believing or making decisions in situations when they do not have all the proof or evidence or knowledge that enables you to make a completely rational or well-informed or prudent decision.', 'But i certainly do not think that faith means thinking, something and not listening to counterarguments, for example.'], ['And i think that insofar as we see ourselves as having some kinds of any kinds of duties or moral compulsions with respect to our relationships, to other people, it is i think it is a question that always arises, well, where does this where do these come from?', 'In mere human relationships, and so it is certainly the case that in christianity there is a sense in which morality and, the morality of morals comes from a transcendent place, from a transcendent deity, and that we ground are the compelling force of morals on god more than we do on individuals.', 'To recognize that certainly in the case of christianity, it is trust and loyalty that the key themes that we are called to and another interesting extension of that you speak to this kind of loyalty is referring to a connection with something outside of yourself.', 'Ok, and so that is what that is one of the things that nature, amongst others, really identify if god is dead, if the idea of god is grounding, our moral behavior is no longer viable in the west, which nietzsche thought that it was not ok, then what does grounded.', 'So i think you have spoken about like existentialism or even just atheism in general as far as leading naturally to an individualism, as a focus on the self and ideas that maybe the christian faith and instill in you is allowing you to sort of look outside of yourself.'], ['And if he is the god of the whole thing, then he is not just the god of the hebrews or in the case of, americans, god is not just the god of americans.', 'But the question of the philosophical question remains, surely if god is good, and god is omnipotent, benevolent, why does not he take away all the suffering?', 'And when we see the passion of jesus, we recognize that god takes suffering deadly seriously, has taken it so seriously that he is been willing to come and be a part of his creation in the person of jesus christ and suffer death, the most horrible death on the cross for our benefit.', 'And, if you want something different, you have got to show that there is a way in which you could invent a world that is better, that it has the integrity that we need to exist, ok, and to be able to think and love and be.', 'There does seem to be a powerful stabilizing like we humans are able to hold ideas together, like in a distributed way outside of whether god exists or not, or that just our ability to kind of converse together towards a set of beliefs into sometimes into tribes.'], ['In my sense, that death is an essential part of life about the essential part of this experience, death of all things.', 'And i talked to quite a few folks who kind of see as the goal of many of our pursuits as to extend life indefinitely as sort of, a dream for many people to live forever.', 'But in the technological world, in the engineering world and the scientific world, that is the big dream to me.', 'And i and i think that death, for example, has been part of the biological world and the universe as a whole from billions of years ago.', 'But then if you actually kind of like you have presented it, if you actually lived that kind of life, you would realize that is actually a step backwards.'], ['I do not think we find out by near-death experiences or those kinds of things, but i think that, that we have sufficient', 'I am i think, like most people, i am more afraid of pain than i am of death, so i do not want to put myself forward as some kind of hero that does not worry about these things.', 'But i do not think that it is life in this universe or in this certainly not in this body and maybe not in a certain sense in this mind.', 'I think it would be a nightmare, not a dream, a nightmare, to be somehow downloaded into a computer and live one', 'Do you think it is possible to know what happens after we die?'], ['What do you make from almost a religious perspective that we have been talking about, of the special aspect of human nature, of us creating intelligence systems that exhibit some elements of that human nature?', 'Let me ask you about the human level or superhuman level intelligence, the artificial intelligence systems.', 'There is a feasibility question of how hard is it to actually build machines, the human level intelligence, or have something like consciousness or have all those kinds of human qualities?', 'So this is a place that, again, maybe taking a slight step outside wherever, philosophising a little bit.', 'But i think one should be a little bit more modest about one'], ['I am thinking about the internet, search engines and so forth, which are enormously influential and obviously do things more powerfully than any individual human or even any combination of humans could do much faster and and accessing databases and so on and so forth is all of this is outstripped our human intelligence.', 'So i think that there are ways in which today we have seen computers do things which historically were regarded as being very characteristic of human intelligence.', 'I also think that, there are certain things which one might think of as being ai, which are, completely widespread in our society.', 'And i when i am talking about when i was in high school, i thought it was pretty unlikely that a computer would be able to become good at chess.', 'And it multiplies our ability to access human knowledge and data and so forth.'], ['I think the bible does not have much in the way of answers about that directly, in the sense that you are perhaps asking it, which is more like i think you are asking for some kind of quasi scientific or maybe indeed scientific description.', 'But i think there is a literature that you one could tap to think about if you want to start early on the question.', 'Personally, i think it is an interesting question, but it is not a very pressing question at the moment.', 'So if you distinguish between those two things, i think the question that is being addressed more directly, scientifically as well as in other ways, it is what is the mind?', 'And i think the same way about the question of what happens if we are able to build a sentient robot, for example.'], ['But i am but i am not at all worried as some people are and some people speak as if it is a good thing that somehow the concepts of humanity and the mind and religion and consciousness are going to vanish because we are going to have complete physical chemical description of the brain in the near future that we are not going to have that.', 'The resolution that we have, that comes out of nmr and brain scans and so forth is miserable compared with what we need in order to understand the brain at the cellular level, let alone at the atomic level.', 'Well, i find kind of compelling that the notion that whoever created this universe and us did so to understand itself himself, there is a powerful self reflection notion to this whole experiment that we are a part of.', 'The time resolution is also completely hopeless compared with what we need to understand the thought, so there is a long way to go', 'And secondly, even if we had it, the mind and all these other things are not going to vanish because of it.'], ['I do not think it makes sense to think of it as a simulation hypothesis in the sense that we are really lying in banks of on banks, of beds, having our energy drained away from us.', 'Christians might hypothesize, but i think that that it is important to recognize that christian theology, at any rate, is that god is not one of the entities in the universe and presumably, therefore, is very different from a simulation that we might run on a computer.', 'I think the most important thing that christians get from the story of adam and eve and the eating, the apple and so forth, is that the relationship between humans and god is broken, has been broken by man’s disobedience.', 'But i think it is important to recognize that the simulation in that concept, the simulation and the creation of the universe are the same thing.', 'There is something called the simulation hypothesis that is been fun to talk about with the computer scientists and so on, which is a kind of thought experiment that proposes that, the entirety of the world around us is a kind of computer program that is a simulation, and then we are living inside it.'], ['But ultimately, i think a person who has faith in a creator who we think has a an intention, many intentions, but but a will in respect of the world as a whole, that is a crucial part of meaning.', 'And that, i think to some people sounds very scary, but actually it is terrifically liberating and i think that love then brings you into service towards another.', 'I tell a story in my book that when i was a student, before i became a christian, i read a philosophy book whose approximate title was what what is the meaning of life?', 'But i do think that those things which give meaning to a life are very important and we should emphasize them.', 'And the idea that my life might have some small significance in

inheritance as discrete units, throughout the life of mendel and well, after his writing, people thought that his experiments were just a little fluke, that they were just, a little exception that would normally not even apply to humans, that basically what they saw is this continuum of eye color, this continuum of skin color, this continuum of hair color, this continuum of height.', 'The first person to understand digital inheritance was mendel, of course, and his theory, in fact, stayed in a bookshelf for like 50 years while darwin was getting famous about natural selection.', 'If you look at natural history of human population, there is actually selection for height in northern europe and selection against height in southern europe.', 'Basically, life is digital, and that is absolutely beautiful about life, the fact that at every replication step you do not lose any information because that information is digital.', 'If there is only five genes and you inherit some combination of them and everyone makes you two inches taller or two inches shorter, it will look like a continuum trait, a continuous trait.'], ['And was really absolutely beautiful about humans today is that lateral transfer of ideas and culture is not just from uncles and aunts and teachers at school, but it is from wikipedia and review articles on the web and thousands of journals that are sort of putting out information for free and podcasts and video games and all of that stuff where you can basically learn about any topic, pretty much everything that would be in any super advanced textbook in a matter of days.', 'And i think the current pandemic and the speed at which the scientific community has moved in the current pandemic, i think exemplifies this horizontal transfer and the speed of horizontal transfer of information and the fact', 'So the democratization of knowledge and the spread, the speed of spread of knowledge is what defines, i think, the human inheritance pattern.',

genome outside of just humans, but is there something that you find beautiful about the human genome specifically?'], ['Arc towards perfection, i think so much more important than how far you are in your first step, and i think that is sort of the current pandemic has taught us the fact that, yeah, no, of course, we are going to make mistakes, but at least we are going to learn from those mistakes and become better and learn better and spread information better.', 'It is the ability to embrace that nothing is permanent when it comes to knowledge that everything is the current best hypothesis and the current best model that best fits the current data and the willingness to be wrong, the expectation that we are going to be wrong, and the celebration of success based on how long

spreading it?', 'Understanding about growth, understanding about the are not and are t at various time points and then understanding the means of spread how it spreads from person to person.', 'I was exactly right, because no one is going to be exactly right with partial knowledge.'], ['So it is embarrassing that it took us this long to focus on it or the eating everything that the model organisms have been taken over because of the power of human genetics, that right now it is actually simpler to figure out the phenotype of something by mining this massive amount of human data than by going back to any of the other species.', 'Or if you are trying to implement this, like if we took this data set of 100000 examples and scaled it to one hundred billion examples with this method, like look at the bigger picture, which is what a wikipedia article would actually try to do, which is like what does this mean in the context of computer, the broad field of computer vision or something like that?', 'So many nature papers are scrutinized, and just because more of them are being proven wrong than in other articles is actually evidence that they are actually better, better papers overall because they are being scrutinized at a rate much higher than any other journal.', 'You do not go to wikipedia and you go to the review articles, but it can be profound in the way that articles rarely one of the frustrating things to me about like certain computer science, like in the machine learning world articles, they do not as often take the bigger picture view.', 'And the human genome was, in fact, relegated to sort of all the last place that you are going to go to learn something new that has dramatically changed.'], ['I have sort of made it my mission to apply the power of computer

brain and the particular abundance of receptors that you have this day based on what you ate yesterday or that you have been wired with, based on, your parents and your upbringing, et cetera, determines a lot of that, quote unquote, free will component to, sort of narrower and narrower, sort of slices so much on that point.', 'So if you look at the trend with and the speed with which human genetics has progressed, we can now find thousands of genes involved in human cognition, in human psychology, in the emotions and the feelings that we used to think are uniquely learned.', 'You know,

understanding of biology.'], ['And eventually, photoreceptors evolved and the ability to sense colors by sort of catching different parts of that electromagnetic spectrum and hearing evolved and touch evolved, etc., but no organism evolved our way to sense neutrinos flowing through earth or gravitational waves flowing through earth, etc..', 'So it is there is no doubt in my view that the more we understand about the tricks that our human brain has evolved to understand the physical world around us, the more we will be able to bring new computational primitives in our a.i. systems to, again,',

yet inhabiting the same universe that we live in with a very tiny little subset of functions from all possible mathematical functions.', 'All of these things we have built intuitions for the physical world that we inhabit and our brains and the brains of all animals evolved for that world.', 'And i find it so beautiful in the history of not just humanity, but life on the planet that we are now able to capture additional signals from the physical world than we ever knew before.'], ['So basically this series of papers in my career have basically first developed that concept of evolutionary signatures and then apply them to yeast, apply them to flies, apply them to for mammals, apply them to 17 fungi, apply them to 12 or softlayer species, apply them to then twenty nine mammals and 200 mammals.', 'So just by scanning a sequence, ignoring the sequence and just looking at the patterns of change, i am wow, this thing is evolving like a protein and that thing is evolving like a motif and that thing is evolving.', 'What my beauty work showed is that when you do that, when you line up species on top of each other, you can see that within protein coding genes, there is a particular pattern of evolution that is dictated by the level at which evolutionary selection acts.', 'So for the first time, we basically developed the concept of genome wide evolutionary signatures, the fact that you could look across the entire genome and understand how things evolve.', 'So if you look at the evolution of this of viruses, the one protein has evolved very rapidly because it is attaching to different hosts each time we think of them as bats.'], ['Yes, and part of the reason is that if you look at mammalian evolution early on in this mammalian radiation that basically happened after the death of the dinosaurs, is that some of the viruses that we had in our genome spread throughout our genome and created binding sites for new classes of regulatory proteins.', 'Many people have a misconception of viruses are smart or viruses are mean, they do not care.', 'They do not care another thing, oh, is a virus trying to kill it?', 'So the search, the basically the brute force search that is happening with viruses because there is so many more of them than humans, then they are taken as a whole are more intelligent.', 'And these binding sites that landed all over genome are now control elements that basically control our genes and sort of help the complex of the circuitry of mammalian genomes.'], ['Just like any messenger rna, we have tens of thousands of messengers, rna is in our cells in any one time and every one of our cells, it throws in one rna and that rna.', 'We are hardwired to make only one protein from every rna molecule, and yet this virus goes in, throws in a single messenger rna.', 'The way that it is encoded, the way that it tracks your cells into making 30 proteins from a single rna.', 'Human cells make one protein from each rna molecule.', 'Two thirds of that rna make a single giant protein.'], ['And then you have lost the battle, that cell is now only making proteins for the virus that will then create the spike protein, the envelope protein, the membrane protein, that nuclear capsid protein that will package up the rna and', 'And basically, instead of sort of having a single full negative strand rna, it basically has a partial negative trend rna that ends right before the beginning of that gene and another one that ends right before the beginning of that gene.', 'So had a spike even to translate this positive strand rna virus has a reverse transcriptase, which is an rna based reverse transcriptase.', 'These negative janani is now make a positive trend rna that then look to the human wholesale just like any other human marinates.', 'Then all of the ribosomes that normally make protein in your human cells are now only able to translate viral rna and make more and more of them.'], ['Basically, if you look at our immune system, there is layers and layers of diversity, like the way that you create your cells generates diversity because of the selection for the videgaray combination that basically eventually leads to a huge number of repertoires.', 'So if you look at human disease, all of the genetic associations that we do with human disease, you basically see the imprint of these waves of selection killing off gazillions of humans.', 'So if you look at now the genetic associations of blood type and immune function cells, etc., there is actually associations, genetic variation that basically says how much more likely am i or you to die if we contact the virus?', 'And if you look at the frequency of sickle cell disease and the frequency of malaria, the maps are actually showing the same pattern, the same imprint on africa.', 'If you look at how europe was shaped and how africa was shaped by malaria, for example, all the individuals that carry a mutation that protect you from malaria were able to survive much more.'], ['And if you have two different viruses infecting the same cell, they can actually mix and match between the positive side and the negative trend and basically create a new hybrid virus with recombination that now has the s1 from one and the rest of the genome from another.', 'Such a thing would basically start with sars tree or at least some relative of sars, the source genome for the current virus was something completely different.', 'So basically what i am saying that i do not worry for the human species because we are so diverse immunologically, we are likely to be very resilient against so many different attacks like this current virus.', 'If you were to create a, virus like sars that will kill a lot of people, you would probably start with sars.', 'Moreover, there is been various claims of how hard this was mixed in match in the lab because the s1 protein has three different components, each of which has a different evolutionary tree.'], ['If you look at allergies, northern europe, super clean environments, tons of allergies, southern europe, my kids grew up eating dirt, no allergies.', 'You mentioned a lot of people kind of ask, how can we strengthen the immune system to respond to this particular virus?', 'So the more you protect your immune system from exposure, the less opportunity has to learn about non self repertoire in a way that prepares it for the next insult.', 'So, yeah, many fewer people died in greece, but there might actually be a component of genetic immune repertoire, basically.', 'And the reasons that i was playing the gardener was putting all kinds of stuff in my mouth from all kinds of dirt and stuff, tons of viruses.'], ['So, again, when you do not have the homozygous version that i have, your cells are able to burn calories much more easily by sort of flipping and master metabolic switch that involves this your lockers that i mentioned earlier and its target genes are extreme in our life that basically switch your adipocytes during their three first days of differentiation as they are becoming maturity to basically become either fat burning or fat storing fat cells.', 'So, look, the effect on the immune system of the immune system, the effect on brain, the effect on your liver, on your digestive system, on your adipocytes adipose, the most misunderstood organ, everybody thinks, oh, fat, terrible.', 'I think we try to bring this question up a couple of times, but let us return to it again as what do you think is the difference between the way a computer represents information the human genome represents and stores information?', 'Give signals to other cells that i have exercised and you should change in this particular way, which basically reconfigure those receptor cells with the effect of exercise is well understood as the those reconfigurations very little.', 'If you look at cancer, exercise and nutrition, if you look at coronavirus exercise and nutrition, every single aspect of human health gets improved.'], ['So you basically divide the cell instead of half the genome going this way and half the genome going the other way after duplication

humanity and all of the ideals that come with it to the most terrifying genome, i do not know, covid-19, sars-cov-2 and the current pandemic.', 'Why fruit bearing plants, because animals would eat the fruit, would walk around and poop huge amount of nutrients, along with a seed for the plants to spread before that plant were not spreading through animals.', 'So basically from one day to the next, you went from having eight chromosomes to having 16 chromosomes, probably a non disjunction event during a duplication, during a division.', 'And if you look at viruses, the reason why they are so elegant, when you look at the design of these, genome, it seems so elegant.'], ['So the ruthless selection basically means that as soon as one of the random mutations hit one gene, ruthless selection just kills off that gene.', 'Now, in the current pandemic, the genes that evolve slowly in the past are still evolving slowly, which means that they are useful, which means that they are under the same evolutionary pressures.', 'They are just messy things, but they are extremely fall tolerant and they are extremely able to deal with mutations because that is the very way that you generate new functions.', 'That mutation we found out through my work disrupts a perfectly conserved nucleotide position that has never been changed in the history of millions of years of equivalent mammalian evolution of these viruses.', 'It is really useful in the current environment of the genome, which is moving from human to human.'], ['That same genome encodes every single freaking cell type of the

the inhibitory neurons, all of the different classes of parasites, the blood brain barrier, all of that same genome.', 'And a lot of the design paradigms that have made deep learning so successful are ways to get away from their ways to get better training by sort of sending long range messages, these alistar models and the, sort of feed forward loops that, sort of jump through layers of

into what are called two sided networks or platform effects, where you may grow the market on one side and harvest the revenue on the other side.', 'You know, people’s data people, it is really sensitive and social networks are at the core, arguably of many of societal like tension and some of the most important things happening in society.', 'I think that when they do the math, it is going to work out that they still are better off with an advertising driven model.', 'I think there is a tendency for a lot of these social networks to really exploit system', 'So it feels like it is important to get this right, both from a business model perspective and just like a trust perspective.'], ['My my mit colleagues are all and deb roy and others at mit did a terrific paper in the cover of science and they document what we all feared, which is that lies spread faster than truth on social networks.', 'You can design a platform in a way that makes it easy to spread lies and to retreat and spread things on.', 'And they found that false information was more likely to spread further, faster to more people.', 'And most importantly, when you think about this huge, amazing information infrastructure that we have had that is connected, billions of brains across the globe, not just we can access information, got to contribute to it and share it.', 'Another interesting thing was that was not necessarily driven by the algorithms, i know that there is some evidence to feki and others have pointed out in youtube some of the algorithms unintentionally were tuned to amplify more extremist content.'], ['And part of it, going back to what we said earlier is, these revenue models may push them more towards growing fast, spreading information rapidly, getting lots of users, which is not the same thing as finding truth.', 'I do not know what the silver bullet is, but the meta point is that if we spend time thinking about it, we can amplify truth over falsehoods.', 'Do you think it is possible that in the future that everything is on the table in terms of truth', 'Yeah, implicit in what you are saying now is a hopeful message that with platforms, we can take a step towards greater and greater popularity of truth.', 'And it is a thought experiment i have been thinking about if it is possible that our future will have, like the idea of truth'], ['It can also be done in nasty ways and the bad parts, but the good parts are great because you just speed up that clock speed of learning about things, instead of like an old days, waiting to read in a journal or the not so old days when you see it posted on a website and you would read it now on twitter, like people will distill it down.', 'There are going to be people who benefit from a world of where people do not check facts and where truth is relative and popularity or fame or money is orthogonal to truth.', 'But one of the reasons i suspect, that we have had so much progress over the past few hundred years is the invention of the scientific method, which is a really powerful tool or a tool for finding truth and favoring things that are true versus things that are false.', 'And so i am hoping the people keep that in mind and continue to try to embrace not just the truth, but methods that lead to the truth.', 'How can they make conscious decisions to favor truth over falsehoods, favor the better of the kinds of societies and not abdicate and say, well, we just build the tools?'], ['And the people who run these platforms, i think have a social responsibility, a moral and ethical personal responsibility to do a better job and to shut that stuff down, i do not think to shut it down, but to design them in a way that, as i said earlier, favors truth over and over falsehoods and favors positive types of communication versus destructive ones.', 'How do you think if we look forward again, it is impossible to predict the future, but if we look at trends from the past and we try to predict what is going to happen in the rest of the twenty first century, how do you think i will change our world?', 'One of the things that people do that is i think even more dangerous is not picking applied to individual statements of good people.', 'Leadership like the previous president, barack obama has been, i think, quite eloquent at work in this very difficult line of talking about cancer culture, was it difficult?', 'And that is certainly true with all the new digital technologies that we have to figure out, not just technology to protect us, but ways of using them that emphasize that are more likely to be successful than dangerous.'], ['Do you think you will be surprised to see what the twenty four to travel in time 100 years into the future, do you think you will

loving each other and discussing philosophy and playing and doing all the other things that do not require work.', 'When i look around the world and think of whether it is child care or health care, clean the environment, interacting with people, scientific work, artistic creativity', 'So but in general or do you not even think about in this kind of way, your self critically thinking, how good are you as an economist at predicting what the future looks like when it starts getting i feel reasonably comfortable the next five, 10, 20 years in terms of that path.', 'Then it is possible that machines will be able to do most of what people do, say one or two hundred years.'], ['When you start getting truly superhuman artificial intelligence, kind of by definition, be able to think of a lot

is a nanotechnology or biotech and weaponized viruses, ai and other things, nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons.', 'Of course, the old school technology, the good old nuclear weapons that could be devastating or even existential new things yet to be invented.', 'If there is literally no intelligent life out there in the universe or at least in our galaxy, that means that we have passed at least

skills.', ', i see super hard working people are not really seeing their wages grow over the past 20, 30 years, while some other people who have been super smart and or super lucky have had, have made billions or hundreds of billions.', 'Been designed and evolved in a way that i think very unfair to a lot of hard working people', 'At one point, tax rates were on top, incomes were significantly higher, and they have come down a lot to the point where in many cases they are lower now than they are for poor people.'], ['If everybody did more research and i would make this applied development versus basic research, so apply development like how do we get this self-driving car future to work better in the tesla?', ', you need the government to be involved and the us government used to be investing much more in r&d, but we have slashed that part of the government really foolishly and we are all poorer, significantly poorer.', 'And paul romer later got a nobel prize for noting that investments in r&d and human capital can speed the rate of tech progress.', 'My erstwhile mit colleague, bob soula, got the nobel prize not yesterday, but three years ago for describing that most improvements in living standards come from tech progress.', 'The problem is with basic research like coming up with core basic ideas, whether it is in nuclear fusion or artificial intelligence or biotech there.'], ['And what we found was that before the pandemic, at the beginning of twenty, about one in six, a little over 15 percent of americans were working remotely when the pandemic hit that grew steadily and hit 50 percent, roughly half of americans working at home.', 'Do you think do you think it is going to be sticky in a sense that after the vaccine comes out and the economy reopens,

magnified by, reporters and all that kind of stuff, are the people that fall into this category that we were referring to just now where they can still function and be successful with remote work.', 'I think a lot of people are discovering that these tools that thanks to technologies have been developed over the past decade, there are a lot more powerful than we thought.', 'And then there is a kind of quiet, quiet suffering of what feels like millions of people whose jobs are disturbed profoundly by this pandemic.', 'Like if someone had some question about some of the data or a reference or whatever, that someone else in the chat would answer it and the whole thing just became like a higher bandwidth, higher quality thing.', 'We have moved to a new remote work system and it is not going to snap all the way back to where it was before.'], ['You know, almost every economist thinks that free trade is a good thing, that when two people voluntarily exchange, almost by definition, they are both better off if it is voluntary and to generally trade is a good thing.', 'And ultimately, we are all going to be wealthier if more people can contribute, more people have the wherewithal.', 'And now i think there are a lot of people who are looking at the political system', 'But they also recognize that trade can lead to uneven effects, that there can be winners and losers in some of the

meaning, like a dog has its meaning.', 'It is, i think also the place where we can actually see the center of our galaxy 42 is the numeric representation of the star symbol in ascii, which is very

a self of self awareness comes probably from being able to project another person’s intentions.', 'We are now competing on intelligence and we are now competing on social structures and we are now

appear out of the darkness of space, which i recently learned is not that easy to give you another number to them.', 'So by hardware upgrades, i basically mean our neocortex and the expansion in these layers and folds of her brain and all of that.', 'Seriously, if you look at progress, if you look at, again, the speed with which knowledge has been transferred, what has led to humanity making so many advances so fast.', 'And, the hardware has not changed much in the last, what, 70000 years.'], ['So what i am trying to say is that these software upgrades for human language, human culture, human environment, human education have basically led to this enormous explosion of knowledge.', 'This whole concept of creating abstract notions of creating these layers of cognition and layers of

software improvements happen through horizontal inheritance.', 'So we basically have a good 16 years, 18 years to sort of infuse it with the latest and greatest in software.', 'So, the asteroid, yes,

mitochondria in his body are only experiencing one layer, the chloroplasts are only experiencing one layer, the photoreceptors and the smell receptors and the chemical receptors like the lion, always attacks against the wind so that it is not smelled like all of these things are one layer at a time.', 'So if you look at our reasoning layer, it is built on top of a cognitive layer and the reasoning layer we share with a.i.', 'We share this cognitive layer of playing chess.'], ['We were able to sufficiently evolve cognitively through the hardware explosion and sufficiently involve scientifically through the software explosion to basically get at breaking through the matrix, realizing that we live in a matrix and realizing that we are this thing in there.', 'And yet, if you think about sort of, again, this whole simulation in your analogy, you can think of the reality that we live in as a matrix, as the matrix.', 'So so in terms of these peeling off layers of complexity, somewhere between the cognitive layer and the reasoning layer or the computational layer, there is still some stuff to be figured out there.', 'But the stuff inside here finding the basis for the soul, finding the basis for the ego, for the self, the self awareness, when do when does the spark happen that basically sort of makes you?', 'And i think that is the final frontier of sort of completing our journey through that matrix and maybe duplicating it and in other versions of ourselves through a.i., which is another very exciting possibility.'], ['So it is a combination of the underlying hardware, which if you think about as a geneticist, in my view, the hardware gives you an upper bound of cognitive capabilities, but it is the environment that makes those capabilities shine and reach their maximum.', 'The nature is our genes and our cognitive apparatus, and the nurture is the richness of the environment that makes that cognitive apparatus reach its potential.', 'It is fascinating to think that humans will look very different a hundred years from now just because the environment changed, even though we are still the same great apes, the descendants of apes.', 'The rest is the, the cortical layers doing their thing in the same way that when we build, these conversational systems or these cognitive systems or these deep learning systems, we put the architecture in place.', 'We keep thinking that general intelligence might just be forever away, but it could just simply be that we just need a ton more hardware and that humans are just not that different from the great apes except for just a ton more of it.'], ['And you basically have this coevolution now of memes and ideas and the cognitive conversational systems that love these ideas and feed on these ideas and understand these ideas and appreciate these ideas now coming together.', 'Who are now growing up in an environment surrounded by other cognitive systems of a similar age with parents who love these types of thinking and ideas, and you basically have a whole interbreeding now of genetically selected transfer of cognitive systems where the genes and the means are evolving the same soup of every improving knowledge and societal.', 'If ideas were evolving in a vacuum of an already established hardware cognitive interconnection system of the planet, where now you basically have the ideas shaping the distribution of these systems and then the genetics kick in as well.', 'With fellowships and the fact that as people apply to m.i.t. from around the world, there is a selection that happens not just for their ideas, but also for the cognitive hardware that came up with those ideas.', 'So you basically have students coming to boston to study because that is the place where these type of cognitive systems thrive and they are selected based on their cognitive output and their idea output.'], ['And if you look at early human language and if you look at how, the great apes

language.', 'And it is either, basically there is a projection that happens from the three dimensional ideas into, let us say, a one dimensional language.', 'And what makes us click so well together is the fact that not only do we have a common mission, a common passion and a common, view of the world, but that we are complementary in our skills, in our angles with which we come at it and so

knowledge and idea and coding would be far inferior because the re encoding with our own, as we said last time, emotional baggage and cognitive baggage from our unique experiences through our shared experiences, distinct encodings in the context of all our unique experiences is leading to so much more diversity of perspectives.', 'It is funny to be both experiencing the past and the present in

states and our cognitive state with a wider audience where suddenly i am sort of realizing that, wow, maybe i have had a legacy.', 'So, so, so through this life in the present, what is really funny is

very conceptual model of the world and can listen and connect to language, all of those things you need to have think all the way through and make sure that your perception system is compatible with your cognition system and language system and all of them.', 'So my way of understanding the brain would be to basically say, look at the insights neuroscientists have found, understand that from a computational angle, information processing angle, build models using that and then building that model, which functions we do not, which is a functional model, which is doing the task that we want to model to do.', 'But i think of perception as kind of the the first thing that you have to build, but the last thing that you will be actually solved, because if you do not build a perception system in the right way, you cannot build a concept system in the right way.', 'Those things in your mind without actually having to act in the world so you can run things like hideously just in your brain, and similarly you can experience another person’s thoughts by having a model of how that person works and running their, putting yourself in some other person’s shoes.', 'We often think about i think thanks to deep learning, you start to think about the human brain as a kind of feed forward mechanism.'], 'subtopics': [['So my way of understanding the brain would be to basically say, look at the insights neuroscientists have found, understand that from a computational angle, information processing angle, build models using that and then building that model, which functions we do not, which is a functional model, which is doing the task that we want to model to do.', 'So blue brain or henry markham’s project is trying to build a brain without understanding it, just trying to put details of the brain from neuroscience experiments into a giant simulation by putting more and more neurons more and more details.', 'So neuroscientists alone, just from experimentation, will not be able to build a model of the brain or a functional model of the brain.', 'Objectively what are the things that we know about the brain and how that can be used to build a model which can then go back and inform how the brain works.', 'The following is a conversation with dileep george, a researcher at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, co-founder of the karius scott phoenix and formerly co-founder of numenta with jeff hawkins, who is been on this podcast, and donna dubinski from his early work on hierarchical temporal memory to recursive cortical networks to today to leap’s, always sought to engineer intelligence that is closely inspired by the human brain.'], ['So what we are seeing is not just a feed forward thing that just gets interpreted in different food, but we are constantly projecting our expectations onto the world and what the final push is a combination of what we project onto the world, combined with what actual sensory input is almost like trying to calculate the difference and then trying to interpret the difference.', 'And this inference includes projecting your model onto the evidence and taking the evidence back into the model and doing an iterative procedure.', 'So, hosn, how the world should be based on your world model and just looking at if there is novelty like trying to explain it', 'You are trying to now explain this evidence using your model of the world.', 'And then you can also find which layer in the in v1, which layer is encoding the edges, which layer is encoding the surfaces, and which is including the feedback which there is encoding the feed forward and what the combination of them that produces the final person.'], ['One hypothesis that you can think of a cortical column as encoding a concept, a concept know think of it as an example of a concept is eastern edge percent or not or is an object present or not.', 'And then there are connections within the cortical column that are each cortical column is implemented using multiple layers of neurons with very, very, very rich structure.', 'There know there are thousands of neurons in a cortical column, but there are structures similar across the different cortical contact.', 'So i would just think of concepts in that kind of way, or is it a lot messier, a lot more gray area, even more gray if a more messy than the artificial neural network kinds of abstractions?', 'So and then within a layer of the neural network, you can the cortical neural network is much more structured with, within a level that it is a lot more intricate structure there, but.'], ['So we looked at neuroscience for insights on how to build a model, and we synthesized all those insights into a computational model.', 'And that, again, is a vision system that becomes a computer vision system that the computer vision takes in images and outputs.', 'So this is a fully functional model for the micro circuits of the visual cortex.', 'This is called recursive cortical network model that we used for breaking', 'This is a model that says this is how vision works.'], ['And so that means if you finally want to have a system that understand concepts about the world and can learn it in a very conceptual model of the world and can listen and connect to language, all of those things you need to have think all the way through and make sure that your perception system is compatible with your cognition system and language system and all of them.', 'Ok, so one important thing constraint that went into the model is that you should not think we can think of vision as something in isolation.', 'So our visual system is tuned for natural signals and there are fundamental assumptions in the architecture that are derived from natural signal properties.', 'So that means context, so think of, you can close your eyes and think about the details of one object, right?', 'It is not obvious that this was the constraint into the that went into the model, this top down controllability of the january model.'], ['Yeah, so you can think of the delta between the model and the convolutional neural network if people are familiar with convolutional networks.', 'But then how is that prior knowledge represented in the model such that inference when some piece of evidence comes in, can be done very efficiently and in a very distributed way?', 'It uses all these players, but it is stored in our visual system in a particular way that is amenable to inference.', 'And then there is this idea of doing inference and neural network does not do inference on the fly.', 'Because it is very there are so many ways of representing knowledge which is not amenable to very quick inference, quick lookups.'], ['So an example of why this inference is important is so one of the first applications that we showed in the paper was to track text based captures what it captures, by the way.', 'What, what are captures so captures are those things that you fill in when you are, if you are opening a new account in google, they show you a picture.', 'If you want to understand how human perception works and if you want to build systems that work like the human brain', 'So so this is a capture by design, things that are easy for humans to solve, but hard for computer, hard for robots.', 'And i would not say captus to solve a problem, we have cracked the fundamental defense of capturers, but it is not solved in the way that humans solve it.'], ['And then the kind of errors it makes are also i do not want to read too much into it, but the kind of errors the network makes are very similar to the kinds of errors humans would make in a similar situation.', 'So you mean inference like in the words used when you talk about reasoning, for example, as opposed to like inference, which is a word with artificial neural networks, which is a single part of the network.', 'Ok, so like you are basically to some basic forms of reasoning, like integration of like how local things fit into the picture and things like explaining away coming into this one, because you are explaining that piece of evidence as something else, because globally that is the only thing that makes sense.', 'So what you want to do is be able to do dynamic inference rather than just being able to show all those combinations in the training time.', 'So why capture why attack the capture problem, which is quite unique in the computer vision context versus like the traditional benchmark’s of image that and all those kinds of image classification or even segmentation tests, all that kind of stuff.'], ['Lateral connections are coming to best explanation of the scene as the problem to solve, trying to solve recognition segmentation all jointly in a way that is compatible with higher level cognition, top-down attention, all those ideas that we brought together into something coherent and workable in the world and solving a challenge, tackling a challenging problem, i think that will stay.', 'So if you read the abstract of the paper and the argument we are putting in, we are putting in look, current deep learning systems take a lot of training data.', 'Is a problem that is by definition hard for computers and it has these good properties of strong general systems strong out of training, distribution, generalization.', 'So there was also versions of multiple versions of imust, including the standard version which we inverted the problem, which is basically saying rather than train on sixty thousand training data', ', how quickly can you get to high level accuracy with very little training data, which is there some performance you remember'], ['That immediately grabs people’s imagination, not even like neural networks, but like really brain is probably more like brain, like neural networks.', 'You know, you can use it as a marketing tool and people often use it and you can get combined with them.', 'And when people do not understand how are approaching the problem, it is easy to be misunderstood and think of it as purely marketing.', 'Like it seems like the people who write articles about these things, they literally have not even spent an hour on the wikipedia article about what is on that.', 'But i think putting aside the ideas of the actual performance and captures or performance, any data set, to me, all these data sets are useless anyway.'], ['I did this, actually wrote a paper and just gotten the chance to really study peripheral vision, which is a fascinating thing, very under understood thing of what the at the every level the brain does with the periphery into some funky stuff.', 'So things like back propagation, credit assignment, so many of these algorithms have learning algorithms have things in common.', 'Were there was an adjustment to your understanding of the brain or is it all just building atop each other in terms of the higher level ideas, especially the ones jeff wrote about in the book?', 'If you if you blurt out right in unintelligence, say unintelligence, if you blur out the details and if you just zoom out and at the high level idea of things are, i would say, consistent with what you wrote about.', 'So so one point of difference i had with jeff was how to approach, how much of biological plausibility and realism do you want in the learning algorithms?'], ['Like it is more i would say, of the concepts in the visual and the motor system and, the the concept learning system, which if you cut off the language part just to just what we learn by interacting with the world and abstractions from that, that is a prerequisite for any real language understanding.', 'So so we have taken one pastorate basically saying what is the basic cognitive architecture that you need to have, which has a perceptual system, which has a system that learns dynamics of the world and then has something like a routine program learning system on top of it to learn concepts?', 'And you think kind of the visual, the visual world concepts in the visual world are somehow lower level than just the language.', 'But that is kind of a simple association thing rather than a concept as an abstraction of something that happens in the real world, in a grounded way that i can simulate it in my mind and connect it back to the real world.', 'You do not know the language or that person uses you want to communicate to that person or to achieve some task.'], ['But i think of perception as kind of the the first thing that you have to build, but the last thing that you will be actually solved, because if you do not build a perception system in the right way, you cannot build a concept system in the right way.', 'And it is stored in your visual system, water system in a way such that it can be accessed through language.', 'So so you have to build a perception system, however long that might be, you have to still build that and learn concept from there', 'Is that language is simulation control and your perceptual plus motor system is building a simulation of the world.', 'And then, keep iterating and finally, perception will get solved fully when perception, cognition, language, all those things work together.'], ['Right, he has a model of english text which is based on fuster, remarkable things, second-order marcovicci instead of marketing something that octoroon magazines look better than fuster, remarkable things that.', 'Maybe it will be forced to figure out abstractions which look awfully a lot like the kind of things that we think about as far as concepts, as world models, as common sense that possible?', 'In that level, when you go higher order models or more sophisticated structured in the model like the transwoman networks, that, yes, they have a model of the world.', 'Off the wall, it is a model of the world and it will have interesting properties and it will be useful, but just scaling it up is not going to give us 80 or natural language, understanding or meaning.', 'Speaking of which, if we could talk about chapter three a little bit, i think it is an interesting, thought provoking set of ideas that openair is pushing forward, i think is good for us to talk about the limits and the possibilities and all that work.'], ['So just because exactly what you are saying is like the ideas of concepts and be able to reason with those concepts and connect those concepts in like hierarchical ways, and then to be able to have world models', 'And you believe in the feedback mechanism of coercion and also, causality, know, being able to do counterfactual reasoning, being able to do interventions, which is actions in the world.', 'To me, it is really surprising the fact that neural networks work at all is quite surprising, given how nonlinear the spaces.', 'I guess the question is whether the neural network architecture, these very simple transformer’s.', 'It is very good at statistical modeling of text and it will become better and better with more data, bigger models.'], ['So when you come to a new situation like your cortex is doing influence over the new situation, and then, of course, the hippocampus is connected to different parts of the cortex.', 'And then whenever you want to reconstitute that memory and evaluate the different aspects of it, whether it was good or bad, do i need to encounter the situation again?', 'So the memories remain and they they are an index into this, like the statistical thing that you form, statistical, causal, structural model that you built over time.', 'That is in the model of the world that you have learned, although the situation came from the episode, you need to be able to index the other one.', 'You need the cortex to reinstate you to replace that memory.'], ['It is possible that you can put many of these structures into neural networks and we will find ways of combining properties of neural networks and graphical models.', 'Well, let me ask you this, a guy named elon musk, there is a company called newlink and there is a general field called brain computer interfaces.', 'But putting back into the cortex and then putting it back into the cortex, of course, affects what you are going to see next in your current situation.', 'Rather than being driven by my current input stimuli, i am going back in time and rewinding experience for playing it.', 'So but to me, it is the direction is pretty clear in looking at biology and the history of our evolutionary history of intelligence.'], ['So just connecting to all of wikipedia, it is interesting whether we need to be able to figure out the basic protocol of the brain’s communication schemes in order to get them to the machine and the brain to talk, because another possibility is the brain actually just adjusts to whatever', 'Let us, let us keep that aside for the time being, even just the intermediate milestones that pursuing, which are very reasonable, as far as i can see, being able to control an external limb, using internet connections from the brain and being able to write things into the brain.', 'Those things in your mind without actually having to act in the world so you can run things like hideously just in your brain, and similarly you can experience another person’s thoughts by having a model of how that person works and running their, putting yourself in some other person’s shoes.', 'So like being able to connect electrodes and not just thousands, but like millions to the brain, i think it is very, very hard because you also do not know what the what will happen to the brain with that.', 'It is a brain adapting to one way, say the brain is connected to like the internet is connected to.'], ['The goals are not quite the same thing as like the, ah, mortality, it feels first of all, humans do not have a goal and they just kind of create goals at different levels.', 'But there is no reason for that mortality to come to the question for a artificial system because we can copy the artificial system.', 'If we reason for some existence proof, you could say that it does not feel like death is a fundamental property of an intelligence system.', 'But it is also possible that the thing that you mentioned, will, with us humans is actually furnham of fundamental importance for intelligence.', 'They like make up goals

happen, and i was taking a lot of psychology classes, a lot of computer science classes as a college student, and i thought, something that can play tic tac toe and just like learn to get better at

do you remember like', 'So what is that in college, when you first learn about neural networks for which you like how it was in its psychology class?', 'I have always been a bit of a cognitive

make learning, that learns to behave in which way was reinforcement learning.', 'So the very first neural net paper that could handle x or so x or sort of killed neural nets.', 'And to me, learning is about learning to behave.', 'Where they are trained as cognitive scientists, but they are looking skeptically at the results in the artificial intelligence neural net kind of world and saying,'], ['So like one part of computer science, that it makes people feel warm and fuzzy inside is when you can prove something like that, a sorting algorithm, worst case runs and log in and it makes everybody feel so good, even though in reality it does not really matter what the worst cases, what matters like this, this thing actually work in practice and this particular actual set of data that i enjoy.',

great is that you get modularity, you can take that thing and plug it into another thing and still have some understanding of what is going to happen when you click them together.'], ['So that is where maybe you can correct me, but that is where, the continuation of the spirit and actually like literally the exact algorithms of turgeman are applied by mind and open ai to learn games that are a little bit more complex than when i was learning artificial intelligence go was presented to me with artificial intelligence, the modern approach.', 'And so i think people discount the role of people like jerry who who have just a particular set of skills on that topic.', 'I do not know if they explicitly pointed to go in those books as like unsolvable kind of thing, like implying that these approaches hit their limit in this for this particular kind of game.', 'We are so drawn to the idea that it is the technology that is where the power is coming from, that i think we lose sight of the fact that sometimes you need a really good and just like no one would think, hey, here is this great piece of software.', 'So i used the term in my 1996 phd dissertation, while the actual term says yes, because the sorrow’s paper was something like training up an expert backgammon player through s play.'], ['And you can set that up as a reinforcement learning problem and you can, have a neural net, represent the value function so that it is taking where all the elevators, where the button pushes this high dimensional well at the time, high dimensional input, a couple of dozen dimensions and

learned a better strategy than the standard one that is implemented in elevator controllers.', 'To me, philosophically, being able to persist in the face of, like long odds, because it feels like for me i will be one of the skeptical people in the room thinking that you can learn your way to beat go like it sounded like especially david silverstein.', 'So you are kind of saying the engineering is kind of fascinating, both on the wood for goes, probably just gathering all the data right out of the expert games, like organizing everything, actually doing distributed, supervised learning.', 'So they came out of the same lab, very influential machine learning, reinforcement learning researcher now defined as just as is rich, though, different sites.'], ['So at least last time i checked, i do not know what the very latest is, but last time i checked that there were teams of people who could work with computer programs to defeat the best computer programs in the game, go in the game of chess and the game of chess.', 'My from talking to go experts, the depth, the strategic depth of go seems to be substantially greater than that of chess, that there is more kind of steps of improvement that you can make getting better and better, better.', 'I think it is interesting because if you have somebody like magnus carlsen who is using these chess programs to train his mind, like to learn to be a better chess player.', 'I do not think i do not think alpha is just better at implementing human strategies.', 'So in particular, computer chess is really interesting because, for of course, for a thousand years, humans were the best chess playing things on the planet.'], ['Humans make more important than the game of chess, that to which self supervised kinds of approaches could be applied, whether it is self play, for example, for like maybe you could think of like autonomous vehicles in simulation, that kind of stuff, or just robotics applications and simulation or in the

about to create intelligent systems that do something really powerful, that pass the turing test or that do some kind of superhuman level performance.', 'The exact same thing could be said by people who are voting for donald trump about joe biden supporters and people voting for joe biden, about donald trump’s supporters is, that they are not intelligent.', 'The human involvement past a certain point and the same thing you could argue is true for the recent breakthroughs in natural language processing with language models.', 'So what is your intuition like trying to stitch all of it together about our discussion of ajai, the limits of self play and your thoughts about maybe the limits of neural networks in the context of language models?', 'General way, it is really good at a bunch of things, and it does seem to understand a lot of the statistics of language extremely well, and that turns out to be very powerful.'], ['And so you can not really deploy reinforcement learning systems into the real world to interact like you could not deploy a language model into the real world to interact with humans because it was just not get enough data relative to the cost it takes to interact with the time of humans is expensive, which is really interesting', 'That the good that expect reinforcement learning and trying to figure out if there is ways to make algorithms that are more efficient at learning, keep the spirit and reinforcement learning and become more efficient.', 'Ok, so i could try and you can correct me, which is he makes an argument that it seems if we look at the long arc of the history of the artificial intelligence field because, 70 years that the algorithms from which we have seen the biggest improvements in practice are the very simple, like dumb algorithms that are able to leverage computation.', 'And i think because these systems are just learning from our stories, they are not learning from being pushed back at by us, that they are fundamentally limited into what they can actually become on this route.', 'I do not believe that you can get something that really can do language and use language as a thing that does not interact with people'], ['And and then what becomes useful to think about, which is exactly what you are saying, the cost of development, like the size of teams, the amount of resources that are invested in continuing to find new curves, new breakthroughs.', ', we do not have to think really hard about the algorithm design or the way that we build the systems, because the best benefit we could get is exponential.', 'Yeah, the but the interesting thing about moore’s law, if you actually look at the technologies involved, it is hundreds, if not thousands of esker stacked on top of each other.',

trying to manipulate us to convince us not to shut them off.', 'Yeah, that called latent semantic analysis that would take words of english and embed them in, multi dimensional space and then use that as a way of, assessing similarity and basically doing reinforcement learning and not sorry, not reinforcing information retrieval, sort of pre', 'The thing about life on earth is they might be borrowing our consciousness and sentience like so like in the sense they do because the creators of the algorithms have like they are not if you look at our body, ok, we are not a single organism.',

people, like charles, my friend charles and others, like a lot of people in my field, a lot of academics, like reading was really a central topic to them, development.', 'I definitely read stop signs,
